I will wrap a lens wipe around the Q-tip to remove stuck-on dirt.

Assess the damage\nFirst, I assessed just how bad things are. My second-generation AirPods Pro are about a year old. Despite a lot of use, they look quite new. The charging case lives inside another protective case -- one from ESR -- and apart from being dirty, looks like new.\nI highly recommend keeping the AirPods charging case inside another protective case, especially if you plan on selling or passing them on at some point.

Apple also offers an official guide on how to clean AirPods, but below is a more in-depth breakdown of how to get the most gunk out of your earbuds.\nWhat you'll need:\nA couple of Q-tips or a cleaner kit.\n-\nA couple of lens wipes.\n-\nOptional: A disposable surface for the cleaning process, like a paper towel (so your table doesn't get covered in earwax).\n-\nOptional: A reliable AirPods case will keep the earbuds and the charging cradle safe and secure.\n-\nI've come across people who use isopropyl alcohol for cleaning but I'm reluctant to drench AirPods in a solvent. I don't think that dissolving earwax and pushing it deeper into the earbuds is all that good for them in the long run. Then there's the possibility of damaging plastics."}

Still, in this price range, mainstream offerings are more compelling for the majority of buyers, mostly for OS integration and better noise canceling, and audiophiles into what Technics have to offer may want to step up to the EAH-AZ80 for better bass for about $50 to $100 more.\nTechnics EAH-AZ80\n$298 at Amazon"}

{"content":"Conclusion\nIf you're in the market for new headphones, you must check out the bone conduction headphones. These are not only safer to use than other types of headphones on the market today, but they also allow you the benefit of having more situational awareness when you're using them. Be sure to check out Shokz bone conduction headphone product lineup today to get your hands on the newest technology taking the market by storm."}
{"content":"Comparing Traditional Headphones with Bone Conduction Headphones\nTraditional headphones have long been the standard and are known to provide immersive sound experiences by enveloping the ears. In contrast, bone conduction technology takes a different approach, which focusess on situational awareness and comfort. This comparison will highlight how each type impacts your listening experience.\nTraditional Headphones\nTraditional headphones excel in creating an immersive audio environment effectively blocking out external noise. This isolation allows for a concentrated listening experience. However, this very feature can also be a drawback. The constant pressure on the ears and the direct sound delivery can lead to auditory fatigue. This makes it necessary to take regular breaks to prevent discomfort and potential hearing damage.\nBone Conduction Headphones"}
{"content":"Myth #4: The sound quality is subpar compared to regular headphones.\nWhen it comes to the sound quality of bone conduction headphones, it's important to realize that it's a bit different than that of traditional headphones. In most cases, when you put on traditional headphones, you don't have to adjust any of the settings. Rather, you just get a clearer quality sound right off the bat.\nDebunking the Myth\nThe study by U.S. Army Research Laboratory explains that while the experience of sound in bone conduction headphones differs from air-conducted hearing, it does not inherently mean lower quality. It's more about understanding and adjusting to the different ways these headphones deliver sound.\nWith appropriate tuning through sound equalizers, bone conduction headphones can achieve a level of immersion, bass, and clarity that rivals conventional headphones. This makes them an excellent choice for both casual music listening and phone conversations.\nConclusion"}
{"content":"Myth #1: Bone conduction headphones are uncomfortable.\nOne of the most common misconceptions about bone conduction headphones is that they are uncomfortable to wear over time, much like most traditional headphones. But the thing is, bone conduction headphones are designed differently. These are remarkably lightweight and are positioned on the cheekbones rather than over or inside the ears. This distinctive placement often leads to a more comfortable experience.\nDebunking the Myth\nRegular headphones can sometimes cause discomfort, such as external compression headaches. This issue arises from the tightness when a headgear is too tight or worn for extended periods. While not everyone experiences these issues, it's not uncommon for traditional headphones users to report some discomfort, particularly during prolonged use."}
{"content":"First, you can still hear your surroundings while using these headphones. This is because they are placed on the cheekbones, and no part of them is placed on or inside of the ear. With traditional headphones, you have some parts of the headphones blocking the ear and your ability to hear your surroundings.\nOne of the biggest struggles most people have with in-ear headphones is that they can lead to compacted earwax blockages. This can lead to trouble hearing and require medical help to remove. In some cases, people even deal with infections because of trapped bacteria in the ear created by the earbuds. With bone conduction headphones, there's never any part of the device that enters the ear. In fact, the ears are left open so they can naturally get rid of earwax and bacteria."}
{"content":"Another great benefit of using bone conduction headphones over traditional headphones is that they don't use as much of your hearing system. Because they can skip the eardrum with their unique sound delivery process, this helps to eliminate your risk of damaging the eardrum while listening to music. The fewer parts of the auditory system you use, the less likely they are to be damaged.\nMyths About Bone Conduction Headphones Safety\nAs with any new product that comes out on the market, people have many different opinions about it. When it comes to bone conduction headphones, there are, unfortunately, many myths that have surfaced. It's a good idea to understand some of these myths and debunk them so that you fully understand the technology behind bone conduction headphones and how they can benefit you.\nMyth #1: Bone conduction headphones are uncomfortable."}
{"content":"Debunking the Myth\nA 2021 research published in the National Library of Medicine sheds light on this issue. It reveals that approximately 1.7% of the global population suffers from noise-induced hearing loss. Interestingly, the study also finds that individuals using headphones in noisy environments are about 4.5 times more likely to experience hearing loss.\nBone conduction headphones have a unique advantage. Their design, which involves stimulating the area near the ear canal opening, significantly improves sound sensitivity. This means that these headphones can effectively transmit sound at lower volumes.\nMoreover, how bone conduction headphones transmit sound keeps the ear canal open. This design is beneficial in noisy surroundings, as it eliminates the need to crank up the volume to overpower ambient noise.\nMyth #3: Bone conduction headphones can cause brain damage."}
{"content":"Myth #3: Bone conduction headphones can cause brain damage.\nIt's not uncommon to think that having vibrations through your cheekbones can lead to brain damage over time. However, it's important to put these vibrations into a realistic perspective. The vibrations that are sent from bone conduction headphones into the skull are at a very mild level. Our bodies experience more powerful vibrations daily than the bone conduction headphones can produce.\nDebunking the Myth\nThe study authored by Mingduo Zhao, Anders Fridberger and Stefan Stenfelt reveals that while different bone conduction vibration frequencies can influence hearing sensations; it is not strong enough to damage the brain. This finding helps dispel concerns about potential brain damage from using bone conduction headphones, affirming their safety for regular use.\nMyth #4: The sound quality is subpar compared to regular headphones."}
{"content":"Sound Quality Premium materials, such as high-grade drivers, top-notch diaphragms, and advanced acoustics, contribute to a fuller, more immersive sound.

{"content":"Sound Quality\nThe most critical aspect when comparing cheap and expensive headphones is, undoubtedly, sound quality. High-end headphones tend to offer a more refined and detailed listening experience. Premium materials, such as high-grade drivers, top-notch diaphragms, and advanced acoustics, contribute to a fuller, more immersive sound.\nOn the other hand, budget headphones have made strides in improving sound quality, offering a pleasant listening experience for everyday consumers. While they may lack the nuanced details and precision of their expensive counterparts, they often provide a satisfactory audio experience for those on a budget.\nBuild Quality and Comfort:\nExpensive headphones typically prioritize durability and comfort. Premium materials like leather, aluminum, and memory foam contribute to a luxurious feel and ensure longevity. The construction of high-end headphones is often more robust, capable of withstanding wear and tear over extended periods."}
{"content":"The debate between cheap and expensive headphones ultimately boils down to individual preferences, priorities, and budget constraints. High-end headphones undoubtedly offer superior sound quality, durability, and advanced features, but the gap between them and their more affordable counterparts is narrowing.\nFor the discerning audiophile with a flexible budget, investing in expensive headphones can be a rewarding experience. However, for those who prioritize value for money, the vast array of budget-friendly options on the market can deliver surprisingly impressive audio quality.\nUltimately, whether you can hear the difference between cheap and expensive headphones depends on your expectations, priorities, and the specific models you're comparing. As technology advances, we can look forward to more affordable headphones providing increasingly competitive audio experiences."}
{"content":"Budget headphones, while not always as durable, have seen improvements in build quality. Many affordable options now feature lightweight yet sturdy materials, ergonomic designs, and cushioned ear cups for enhanced comfort during prolonged use.\nFeatures and Technology:\nExpensive headphones often come equipped with advanced features such as noise cancellation, touch controls, customizable sound profiles, and wireless connectivity options.

{"content":"20kHz: On the other end of the spectrum, this is the highest frequency we can hear. It's a very high-pitched sound, like the ringing of cymbals or the chirping of birds."}
{"content":"-\nAnalyzing the Data: The recorded data is then analyzed using the software. The software measures how loud the output is at each frequency, creating a profile of the headphones' frequency response.\n-\nCreating a Frequency Response Graph: The data is then plotted on a graph, with frequency on the x-axis and volume (in decibels) on the y-axis. This graph is the frequency response graph of the headphones.\n-\nTake note, a frequency response graph doesn't tell the whole story. It doesn't account for factors like soundstage (how the music seems to surround you), imaging (how well the headphones can position sounds), or the overall timbre (character) of the sound. It's just one tool to help you understand how a pair of headphones might sound.\nConclusion"}
{"content":"Bass Frequencies: Bass frequency ranges are the low-end frequencies, typically ranging from 20Hz to 300Hz. They give depth to the sound and are responsible for the \"thump\" you feel in songs.\n-\nMid Frequencies: Ranging from 300Hz to 4kHz, these frequencies represent the human voice and many musical instruments. They give clarity and presence to the sound.\n-\nTreble Frequencies: These are the high-end frequencies, ranging from 4kHz to 20kHz. They add sparkle and crispness to the sound, making instruments like cymbals and violins shine.\n-\nBy understanding the frequency response of headphones, you can choose a pair that aligns with your listening preferences. Whether you're a bass enthusiast or someone who loves crystal clear vocals, there's a pair of headphones out there with the right frequency response for you.\nWhat Frequency Can Humans Hear"}
{"content":"-\nExtended Low-Frequency Range (below 20Hz): Some headphones are designed to reproduce frequencies below 20Hz. These frequencies are often felt rather than heard, adding a sense of power and depth to the music. If you're a fan of bass-heavy genres like EDM or hip-hop, you might appreciate headphones with an extended low-frequency range.\n-\nExtended High-Frequency Range (above 20kHz): Other headphones can reproduce frequencies above 20kHz. While these frequencies are beyond the range of human hearing, some people believe they add a sense of spaciousness and detail to the music.\n-\nThe best frequency response for headphones depends on your personal preferences and the type of music you listen to. Some people might prefer a more balanced sound, while others might prefer headphones that emphasize the bass or treble frequencies.\nWhat is a Good Frequency Response for Headphones"}
{"content":"In addition to the potential for hearing loss, wearing headphones for long periods of time can also lead to other problems. For example, wearing headphones can block out external sounds, which can be dangerous if the listener is in a public place or in a situation where they need to be aware of their surroundings. This can be particularly problematic for people who use headphones while walking, biking, or driving.\nFurthermore, wearing headphones for extended periods of time can also be uncomfortable, as they can put pressure on the ears and cause discomfort. Additionally, using headphones at high volumes can lead to tinnitus, a condition in which a person experiences ringing in their ears.\nIn conclusion, while headphones can be a convenient and enjoyable way to listen to audio content, it is important to use them responsibly and limit their use to no more than one hour per day. By doing so, you can avoid potential hearing loss and other problems associated with prolonged headphone use."}
{"content":"The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people limit their exposure to loud sounds, including music played through headphones, to no more than one hour per day. This is because loud sounds can damage the sensitive hair cells in the inner ear, which can lead to hearing loss."}

{"content":"Additionally, it is important to be mindful of the volume level when using headphones. The louder the volume, the more likely it is to cause hearing damage. The WHO recommends keeping the volume at 60% or less of the maximum volume on your device. This can help to reduce the risk of hearing loss while still allowing you to enjoy your music or other audio content.\nIt is also important to give your ears a break from time to time. Even if you are using headphones at a safe volume level, it is still a good idea to take regular breaks from listening to allow your ears to rest. This can help to prevent discomfort and reduce the risk of hearing damage.\nIn addition to limiting the amount of time you wear headphones and the volume level, it is also important to choose headphones that are comfortable and fit well. Over-ear headphones, for example, can be more comfortable and provide a better fit than earbuds, which can put pressure on the ear canal and cause discomfort."}
{"content":"Overall, the key to using headphones safely and responsibly is to be mindful of the potential risks and take steps to reduce them. By limiting the amount of time you wear headphones and choosing the right headphones for your needs, you can enjoy your audio content without compromising your hearing.\nRecommended by LinkedIn\nIn addition to the potential risks to hearing, wearing headphones for long periods of time can also have other negative effects on the listener. For example, constantly wearing headphones can lead to social isolation and reduced interactions with others. This can be particularly problematic for young people who may be more inclined to use headphones to block out the world around them.\nFurthermore, wearing headphones for long periods of time can also lead to poor posture and neck strain. This is because the headphones can add weight to the head, which can cause the head to be held in an unnatural position. This can lead to discomfort and even chronic pain in the neck and shoulders."}

{"content":"Why Headphones and Earbuds Are Dangerous for Drivers\nAs a driver, you must be able to hear the noises of the road around you. Dedicating 100 percent of your attention to the driving task means listening to your surroundings. This is not possible if you use headphones to talk on the phone, listen to music or listen to a podcast while driving. Listening to headphones will also distract you on a cognitive level, as you will be thinking about what you are listening to instead of the driving task.\nUsing headphones and earbuds while driving is dangerous because it effectively blocks out surrounding sounds. You may not be able to hear a car honking at you, for example, or a pedestrian shouting at you to hit the brakes. This could lead to a car accident and serious injuries. You also might not hear emergency sirens, leading to mistakes such as failing to pull over for an ambulance or police officer.\nConsequences of Wearing Headphones While Driving"}
{"content":"Consequences of Wearing Headphones While Driving\nIf you get caught violating California\u2019s headphones while driving law, the penalty is a fine of $197.00. You will also receive one point on your driving record. If you accumulate too many points in a certain amount of time, the Department of Motor Vehicles may suspend your license for negligent vehicle operation. The limit for license suspension in California is 4 points in 12 months, 6 points in 24 months or 8 points in 36 months. If you miss your court date, you could face additional fines and penalties, including a misdemeanor charge for failure to appear."}
{"content":"California has a law that prohibits drivers and bicyclists from wearing headphones while operating their vehicles. California Vehicle Code 27400 states that no person operating a motor vehicle or bicycle may wear earphones, earplugs or a headset that covers, rests in or is inserted in both ears."}
