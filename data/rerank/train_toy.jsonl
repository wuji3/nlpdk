I will wrap a lens wipe around the Q-tip to remove stuck-on dirt.

Then, use a Q-tip and wipe to clean inside and out.\nFinally, give the earbud itself a good wipe, and you're done.","ZDNET's editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader.

Those AirPods that you stick in your ears on a regular basis -- sometimes for hours on end, often when you're sweating in the gym -- need an occasional cleaning.\nAlso: How to choose the best AirPods for you: Expert advice\nSome people just give them a wipe and get on with their day, while others want to go all the way and fully clean and sanitize their AirPods.","Also: The best earbuds you can buy\nThese lens wipes are inexpensive and only contain 40-50% alcohol, so they're less abrasive and fit for cleaning glasses, camera lenses, screens, and, in this case, AirPods.\n1. Assess the damage\nFirst, I assessed just how bad things are. My second-generation AirPods Pro are about a year old. Despite a lot of use, they look quite new. The charging case lives inside another protective case -- one from ESR -- and apart from being dirty, looks like new.\nI highly recommend keeping the AirPods charging case inside another protective case, especially if you plan on selling or passing them on at some point. A protective case really does prevent scratches and chips.\nI noticed that there's also a fair bit of muck trapped in the Lightning port.\n2. Clean the case","Well, my AirPods Pro have seen a lot of use, and they could do with a clean, so I thought that I'd bring you along for the ride.\nHow to clean and sanitize your AirPods\nNote that while I'm cleaning AirPods Pro here, the process is similar for the standard AirPods. Apple also offers an official guide on how to clean AirPods, but below is a more in-depth breakdown of how to get the most gunk out of your earbuds.\nWhat you'll need:\nA couple of Q-tips or a cleaner kit.\n-\nA couple of lens wipes.\n-\nOptional: A disposable surface for the cleaning process, like a paper towel (so your table doesn't get covered in earwax).\n-\nOptional: A reliable AirPods case will keep the earbuds and the charging cradle safe and secure.\n-\nI've come across people who use isopropyl alcohol for cleaning but I'm reluctant to drench AirPods in a solvent.

{"neg":["Here are some tips for parents to keep their kids safe from noise-induced hearing loss:\nAwareness: Educate yourself about safe noise levels and the potential risks of exposure to loud sounds. Understanding the issue is the first step in preventing hearing loss.\n-\nLimit Exposure: Control your child's exposure to loud noises whenever possible. Avoid or minimize visits to excessively noisy environments such as construction sites, loud concerts, or noisy sporting events.\n-\nUse Ear Protection: In situations where exposure to loud sounds is unavoidable, provide your child with appropriate hearing protection. Use earmuffs or earplugs specifically designed for children. Ensure they fit properly and are comfortable.\n-\nMonitor Volume: Keep an eye on the volume of audio devices your child uses, such as NC 25 headphones, smartphones, and tablets. Most devices have volume limit settings that you can activate to restrict the maximum volume.\n-","-\nSet Volume Limits: Teach your child about safe listening practices. Encourage them to keep the volume at a reasonable level when using headphones or earbuds, and explain the potential consequences of prolonged exposure to loud music.\n-\nTime Limits: Limit the amount of time your child spends using headphones or earbuds. Set reasonable daily or weekly limits to prevent excessive exposure to loud sounds.\n-\nUse Safe Listening Devices: Consider purchasing headphones or earbuds designed specifically for children with built-in volume-limiting features. These devices ensure that the sound doesn't reach harmful levels.\n-\nLead by Example: Model safe listening behavior for your child. Show them that you also use hearing protection in noisy situations and follow the recommended volume guidelines.\n-\nRegular Checkups: Schedule regular hearing checkups for your child with a healthcare professional or audiologist. This can help detect any hearing issues early and provide guidance on safe listening practices.\n-","-\nSupervision: Supervise your child's media consumption, especially when using headphones or earbuds. Make sure they are following safe listening practices.\n-\nUse Noise-Canceling Headphones Cautiously: Noise-canceling headphones can be beneficial in noisy environments, but they can also lead to higher music volumes because the external noise is blocked out. Use them responsibly and ensure your child doesn't turn up the volume excessively.\n-\nEncourage Breaks: Encourage your child to take breaks when listening to music or watching videos with headphones. This gives their ears a chance to rest and recover.\n-","-\nInattention to Surroundings: Wearing headphones can make toddlers less aware of their surroundings, potentially putting them at risk in situations where they need to be alert, such as near traffic or in crowded places.\n-\nExcessive Screen Time: Headphones are often used in conjunction with screens, such as tablets or smartphones. Prolonged screen time can have adverse effects on a toddler's development, including language, cognitive, and motor skills.\n-\nDependency: Toddlers can become dependent on headphones for entertainment, which may lead to difficulties in engaging in other activities, such as playing with toys or interacting with peers.\n-\nNoise-Induced Stress: Constant exposure to noise through headphones can cause stress and anxiety in toddlers. It's essential to strike a balance between auditory stimulation and quiet time for their mental well-being.\n-","-\nNoise-Canceling vs. Noise-Isolating: Noise-canceling headphones may not be suitable for toddlers, as they can block out ambient sounds, making it difficult for them to hear important cues from their environment.\n-\nRegular Hearing Checkups: Schedule regular hearing checkups for your toddler to ensure their hearing is not affected by headphone use.\n-\nRemember that the safety and well-being of your child should always be the top priority.

These headphones ensure that the volume remains at safe levels, preventing any potential damage to your child's ears.\n-","-\nOver-Ear Headphones: Over-ear headphones, specifically designed for toddlers, can provide a comfortable and secure fit. Look for adjustable headbands and soft padding to ensure a snug yet gentle fit.\n-\nOn-Ear Headphones: On-ear headphones, which rest directly on the ears, can be suitable for older toddlers who are more aware of their surroundings. Choose models with cushioned ear cups for added comfort.\n-\nIn-Ear Headphones: In-ear headphones should be avoided for very young children due to the risk of inserting them too deeply into their ears. However, child-specific in-ear headphones with soft, safe materials and secure fittings are available for older kids.\n-\nBluetooth Connectivity: Opt for wireless headphones with Bluetooth connectivity to eliminate the risk of tangled cords and potential accidents.\n-\nSafety Guidelines for Toddler Headphone Use:\nLimit Screen Time: Ensure your child's exposure to screens and headphones is limited and follows age-appropriate guidelines.\n-","Introduction:\nAs parents, we always want the best for our children, and their safety is our utmost priority. With the prevalence of digital devices in our lives, it's not uncommon to wonder whether toddlers can wear headphones safely. In this blog, we will delve into the world of safe listening options for toddlers, ensuring their auditory health is protected while they explore the wonders of sound.\nUnderstanding the Concerns:\nBefore we explore safe listening options, let's understand why there are concerns about toddlers using headphones.\nEar Sensitivity: Young children have more sensitive ears than adults. Prolonged exposure to loud sounds can potentially harm their hearing.\n-\nVolume Control: Toddlers may not understand the concept of safe listening levels and can accidentally increase the volume to unsafe levels.\n-","-\nSupervision: Always supervise your toddler when they are using headphones. This helps you monitor the volume and ensure they are using them safely.\n-\nDuration: Limit the amount of time your toddler spends wearing headphones. Experts recommend no more than one to two hours of headphone use per day, and regular breaks to give their ears a rest.\n-\nParental Control: Some headphones come with parental control features, allowing you to set volume limits remotely through a paired device. Consider using these features for added safety.\n-\nEducational Content: When using headphones, encourage your toddler to listen to educational content or music suitable for their age. This can be a valuable learning tool.\n-\nModeling Behavior: Set a positive example by using headphones responsibly yourself. Children often mimic their parents' behavior.\n-","-\nBy following these guidelines and promoting safe listening habits, parents can introduce headphones to their toddlers in a way that balances entertainment and learning while prioritizing hearing safety. Ultimately, the goal is to provide children with an enjoyable and educational listening experience while minimizing the risk of noise-induced hearing loss. Remember that the safety and well-being of your child should always be the top priority. Use headphones as a tool for learning and entertainment while taking appropriate precautions to protect their hearing.","-\nUnsuitable Content: Without proper monitoring, toddlers may access content that is not age-appropriate or developmentally suitable. Parents need to ensure that the content their child listens to is safe and educational.\n-\nAddiction and Habit Formation: Excessive use of headphones at a young age can lead to habits of using headphones for prolonged periods, which may be challenging to break as children grow older.\n-\nTo mitigate these risks, parents should carefully consider when and how they introduce headphones to their toddlers.

Toddlers' ears are still developing and are more sensitive to loud sounds. Listening to music or other audio at high volumes through headphones can lead to permanent hearing loss.\n-\nImproper Fit: Ill-fitting headphones can be uncomfortable for toddlers and may cause discomfort or even pain. If headphones are too tight, they can also put pressure on the developing bones of the head and ears.\n-\nIsolation: When toddlers wear headphones, they can become socially isolated as they may not hear important cues and conversations in their environment. This can hinder their social development and ability to communicate effectively.\n-","-\nSupervision: Always supervise your child while they are using headphones, especially if they are very young.\n-\nEducate on Volume Control: Teach your child about safe listening levels and how to adjust the volume to a comfortable but not too loud level.\n-\nComfort Check: Regularly check for signs of discomfort, and make sure the headphones fit securely without causing pressure on the ears.\n-\nTake Breaks: Encourage breaks during prolonged headphone use to give their ears some rest.\n-\nConclusion:\nToddlers can wear headphones safely as long as we, as parents, take the necessary precautions. By choosing headphones specifically designed for children, monitoring their use, and educating them on safe listening practices, we can provide our little ones with an enjoyable and risk-free auditory experience. Prioritizing their auditory health will ensure they can continue exploring the world of sound safely and joyfully.\nProtecting children from noise-induced hearing loss is crucial for their long-term auditory health."],"pos":["-\nComfort and Fit: Traditional headphones designed for adults might not be comfortable or secure for toddlers, potentially leading to discomfort or even accidents.Certainly!

{"neg":["Conclusion\nIf you're in the market for new headphones, you must check out the bone conduction headphones. These are not only safer to use than other types of headphones on the market today, but they also allow you the benefit of having more situational awareness when you're using them. Be sure to check out Shokz bone conduction headphone product lineup today to get your hands on the newest technology taking the market by storm.","Comparing Traditional Headphones with Bone Conduction Headphones\nTraditional headphones have long been the standard and are known to provide immersive sound experiences by enveloping the ears. In contrast, bone conduction technology takes a different approach, which focusess on situational awareness and comfort. This comparison will highlight how each type impacts your listening experience.\nTraditional Headphones\nTraditional headphones excel in creating an immersive audio environment effectively blocking out external noise. This isolation allows for a concentrated listening experience. However, this very feature can also be a drawback. The constant pressure on the ears and the direct sound delivery can lead to auditory fatigue. This makes it necessary to take regular breaks to prevent discomfort and potential hearing damage.\nBone Conduction Headphones","Myth #4: The sound quality is subpar compared to regular headphones.\nWhen it comes to the sound quality of bone conduction headphones, it's important to realize that it's a bit different than that of traditional headphones. In most cases, when you put on traditional headphones, you don't have to adjust any of the settings. Rather, you just get a clearer quality sound right off the bat.\nDebunking the Myth\nThe study by U.S. Army Research Laboratory explains that while the experience of sound in bone conduction headphones differs from air-conducted hearing, it does not inherently mean lower quality. It's more about understanding and adjusting to the different ways these headphones deliver sound.\nWith appropriate tuning through sound equalizers, bone conduction headphones can achieve a level of immersion, bass, and clarity that rivals conventional headphones. This makes them an excellent choice for both casual music listening and phone conversations.\nConclusion","Myth #1: Bone conduction headphones are uncomfortable.\nOne of the most common misconceptions about bone conduction headphones is that they are uncomfortable to wear over time, much like most traditional headphones. But the thing is, bone conduction headphones are designed differently. These are remarkably lightweight and are positioned on the cheekbones rather than over or inside the ears. This distinctive placement often leads to a more comfortable experience.\nDebunking the Myth\nRegular headphones can sometimes cause discomfort, such as external compression headaches. This issue arises from the tightness when a headgear is too tight or worn for extended periods. While not everyone experiences these issues, it's not uncommon for traditional headphones users to report some discomfort, particularly during prolonged use.","First, you can still hear your surroundings while using these headphones. This is because they are placed on the cheekbones, and no part of them is placed on or inside of the ear. With traditional headphones, you have some parts of the headphones blocking the ear and your ability to hear your surroundings.\nOne of the biggest struggles most people have with in-ear headphones is that they can lead to compacted earwax blockages. This can lead to trouble hearing and require medical help to remove. In some cases, people even deal with infections because of trapped bacteria in the ear created by the earbuds. With bone conduction headphones, there's never any part of the device that enters the ear. In fact, the ears are left open so they can naturally get rid of earwax and bacteria.","Another great benefit of using bone conduction headphones over traditional headphones is that they don't use as much of your hearing system. Because they can skip the eardrum with their unique sound delivery process, this helps to eliminate your risk of damaging the eardrum while listening to music. The fewer parts of the auditory system you use, the less likely they are to be damaged.\nMyths About Bone Conduction Headphones Safety\nAs with any new product that comes out on the market, people have many different opinions about it. When it comes to bone conduction headphones, there are, unfortunately, many myths that have surfaced. It's a good idea to understand some of these myths and debunk them so that you fully understand the technology behind bone conduction headphones and how they can benefit you.\nMyth #1: Bone conduction headphones are uncomfortable.","Debunking the Myth\nA 2021 research published in the National Library of Medicine sheds light on this issue. It reveals that approximately 1.7% of the global population suffers from noise-induced hearing loss. Interestingly, the study also finds that individuals using headphones in noisy environments are about 4.5 times more likely to experience hearing loss.\nBone conduction headphones have a unique advantage. Their design, which involves stimulating the area near the ear canal opening, significantly improves sound sensitivity. This means that these headphones can effectively transmit sound at lower volumes.\nMoreover, how bone conduction headphones transmit sound keeps the ear canal open. This design is beneficial in noisy surroundings, as it eliminates the need to crank up the volume to overpower ambient noise.\nMyth #3: Bone conduction headphones can cause brain damage.","Myth #3: Bone conduction headphones can cause brain damage.\nIt's not uncommon to think that having vibrations through your cheekbones can lead to brain damage over time. However, it's important to put these vibrations into a realistic perspective. The vibrations that are sent from bone conduction headphones into the skull are at a very mild level. Our bodies experience more powerful vibrations daily than the bone conduction headphones can produce.\nDebunking the Myth\nThe study authored by Mingduo Zhao, Anders Fridberger and Stefan Stenfelt reveals that while different bone conduction vibration frequencies can influence hearing sensations; it is not strong enough to damage the brain. This finding helps dispel concerns about potential brain damage from using bone conduction headphones, affirming their safety for regular use.\nMyth #4: The sound quality is subpar compared to regular headphones."],"pos":["ZDNET's editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader.

The louder the volume, the more likely it is to cause hearing damage. The WHO recommends keeping the volume at 60% or less of the maximum volume on your device. This can help to reduce the risk of hearing loss while still allowing you to enjoy your music or other audio content.\nIt is also important to give your ears a break from time to time. Even if you are using headphones at a safe volume level, it is still a good idea to take regular breaks from listening to allow your ears to rest. This can help to prevent discomfort and reduce the risk of hearing damage.\nIn addition to limiting the amount of time you wear headphones and the volume level, it is also important to choose headphones that are comfortable and fit well. Over-ear headphones, for example, can be more comfortable and provide a better fit than earbuds, which can put pressure on the ear canal and cause discomfort.","Overall, the key to using headphones safely and responsibly is to be mindful of the potential risks and take steps to reduce them.

This can be particularly problematic for young people who may be more inclined to use headphones to block out the world around them.\nFurthermore, wearing headphones for long periods of time can also lead to poor posture and neck strain. This is because the headphones can add weight to the head, which can cause the head to be held in an unnatural position. This can lead to discomfort and even chronic pain in the neck and shoulders."],"pos":["In addition to the potential for hearing loss, wearing headphones for long periods of time can also lead to other problems. For example, wearing headphones can block out external sounds, which can be dangerous if the listener is in a public place or in a situation where they need to be aware of their surroundings. This can be particularly problematic for people who use headphones while walking, biking, or driving.\nFurthermore, wearing headphones for extended periods of time can also be uncomfortable, as they can put pressure on the ears and cause discomfort. Additionally, using headphones at high volumes can lead to tinnitus, a condition in which a person experiences ringing in their ears.\nIn conclusion, while headphones can be a convenient and enjoyable way to listen to audio content, it is important to use them responsibly and limit their use to no more than one hour per day.

Although the sound quality is usually a lot better, this is only the case if your in-ear headphones can stay in your ear canal and remain watertight.

If this does happen, be careful to clean and dry your ears properly to avoid swimmers ear or infection.","How Bone Conduction Headphones Work\nBone conduction headphones are slight different from your typical in-ear headphones, which have been the dominant design for many years now. Bone Conduction headphones operate by pulsing vibrations through bone, usually placed near your temples, and the inside ear cochlea receives the vibrations, which allows us to perceive it as sound. Pretty amazing science! This obviously works slightly differently to in-ear headphones, which emit sound through small speakers down the ear canal and into the eardrum for the cochlea to receive. Relatively speaking this is pretty new technology, first invented in 1994 with athletes specifically in mind.\nThe Pros Of Bone Conduction Headphones","The Cons Of Bone Conduction Headphones\nHowever, bone conduction headphones don\u2019t come without their setbacks.

Sound quality: This is clearly important. You can read more about how we test this below, but you should consider whether you\u2019d prefer a balanced sound or once that favors a particular part of the frequency spectrum \u2014 electronic fans might prefer heavy bass, for example. That said, several over-ear headphones have mobile apps that let you tweak the EQ to your liking.\nANC technology can compress sound and reduce dynamics, which may affect audio performance when turned on. In some cases, you\u2019ll notice a background hiss when listening to music. However, the best noise-cancelling earbuds limit these disruptions to deliver full, crisp sound.\n3. Battery life: Think about how much battery life you\u2019ll need as well. Over-ear headphones can deliver anywhere between about 20 and 60 hours of playback so you should never need to recharge too often, though naturally longer is usually better. Keep in mind that ANC will reduce battery life when it\u2019s turned on, as it needs to permanently power the onboard microphones.","The touch controls and battery life (30 hours with ANC on, 40 with it off) are also to be commended, as is the excellent Sony Headphones Control app, which lets you tweak the EQ to your preference.

Pricing considerations: Obviously, price is a big consideration when looking for the best over-ear headphones. Although there are always exceptions, big-name brands will typically command a bit extra, but generally speaking, the less you spend on a pair of headphones the greater the chance that sound and features will be compromised. Going for a budget option isn't always the best choice, as any money you save on your purchase won't do you much good if you're constantly needing to recharge your audio gear, or the sound quality is poor.\nAs the saying goes: timing is everything; and right now many of our favorite models are being discounted by online retailers, meaning you can bag a bargain for even less.

But if you\u2019re not deep in the Apple world and you\u2019re willing to splurge on the best sound, features and battery life in a pair of earbuds, the Sony WF-1000XM5 are worth the premium.\nOther true wireless earbuds we recommend\nThe AirPods Pro 2 are as good as it gets for Apple users, offering some of the best sound, controls and active noise cancellation you can find in a pair of buds.\nThe follow-up to our previous top noise-canceling pick, the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds retain their predecessor\u2019s best-in class noise suppression while introducing immersive spatial audio.","Belkin SoundForm Freedom True Wireless\n$120 From $27 at Amazon\nThe Belkin SoundForm Freedom True are among the few third-party earbuds that support Apple\u2019s Find My app for tracking down your lost buds.

They aren\u2019t quite as good as the Beats across the board, but they\u2019re a very capable pair or true wireless headphones that come in a bit cheaper than the Beats and are a great choice if you like the Jabra look and feel.\nJabra Elite 85t\n$230 $150 at Amazon\nThe Jabra Elite 85t offers good overall sound and tons of customization via Jabra\u2019s excellent Sound+ app, including 11 levels of active noise cancellation. However, the Elite 85t\u2019s design is a little bulky for our liking, and its semi-open design (which is great for situational awareness while exercising outdoors) makes its ANC less pronounced than on Elite Active 75t.\nJLab JBuds Air ANC True Wireless\n$70 at Target","We\u2019ve long been critical of how big and bulky Sony\u2019s flagship earbuds are, something that was finally rectified with the slick-looking XM4 model. The XM5 (which come in white and black) simply improve on that foundation, making both the earbuds and the case even thinner, lighter and more comfortable. The WF-1000XM5 uphold Sony\u2019s reputation for reliable battery life, promising up to 10 hours of endurance from the buds alone and up to 36 with the charging case. Those claims held up well in our testing \u2014 and beat out top rivals like the AirPods Pro 2 by a notable margin.","JBL Tour Pro 2\n$250 at JBL\nYou certainly won\u2019t find many pairs of earbuds like the JBL Tour Pro 2, which pack a full LCD screen right on the case for doing things like changing sound profiles and checking battery life on the fly. They\u2019re a fun throwback to the iPod days that make it easier to keep your phone in your pocket, and their great sound quality and ANC prove they\u2019re more than just a gimmick. It\u2019s tough to choose these over the sleeker AirPods Pro 2 or Sony WF-1000XM5 in the $250-and-up price range, but those compelled by the Tour Pro 2\u2019s unique selling point will find plenty to like.\nAmazon Echo Buds (2023)\n$50 $49 at Amazon\nThe latest Amazon Echo Buds offer surprisingly good sound and comfort for the price, and their seamless Alexa integration is great for folks who are deep into the Amazon ecosystem.

These buds have a comfortable design, plenty of color options, decent audio for the price and even feature Tile tracking support \u2014 something you won\u2019t find on much more expensive options. We still think the EarFun Air are the better budget option for folks willing to spend closer to $50, but the Dime 2 are a great choice if you\u2019re on an extra tight budget.\nSkullcandy Sesh True Wireless\n$50 at Amazon","Unfortunately, those Assistant tricks are exclusive to Android users, as there\u2019s no Pixel Buds app for the iPhone \u2014 they\u2019re just another pair of generic Bluetooth headphones so far as the iPhone can tell. It\u2019s also worth noting that the Pixel Buds A-Series\u2019 charging case \u2014 which comes in white across all models \u2014 is highly susceptible to smudges and scuffs. Its highly magnetic design also got stuck to other metal objects in our pockets, causing the buds to accidentally slip out on more than one occasion. But if the case isn\u2019t a deal breaker for you, the $100 Buds A are about as good as you can get at this price if you\u2019re on Android.\nJabra Elite 4\n$100 at Jabra\nThe Jabra Elite 4 are some of the best sub-$100 earbuds we\u2019ve tested, offering excellent sound, comfort and noise canceling for the price.

They also sound fantastic, with the satisfying bass you expect from Beats, and pair effortlessly to Apple devices. The Powerbeats Pro are still a good buy if you prefer workout buds that wrap around your ears, but we think the smaller Beats Fit Pro offer better control and are just as secure (and even more comfortable) for both workout and everyday use.\nBeats Studio Buds\n$150 at Amazon\nThe Beats Studio Buds were once our top pick for comfort, thanks to a low profile design that we enjoyed wearing for hours on end. They\u2019re also built to fast-pair to both iOS and Android devices, which is a unique perk for a pair of Apple-made buds. There\u2019s a lot to like here for the price, but the Beats Fit Pro offer even better comfort and features for those willing to pay up.","Bowers & Wilkins Pi7 S2\n$399 From $302 at Amazon; $399 at Bowers & Wilkins\nThis latest update to the audiophile brand\u2019s flagship earbud looks great, fits comfortably and sounds fantastic, with deep bass, smooth mids, and plenty of high end clarity \u2014 subtle sound quality improvements to its already high-performance predecessor. It supports the highest-quality aptX Bluetooth support if you\u2019re using an Android mobile or Windows machine, and a cool travel-friendly case doubles as a transmitter if you need to interface with older gear \u2014 like a plane\u2019s in-flight entertainment system.

However, the buds stumble on battery life, and their fitness-tracking capabilities aren\u2019t as reliable as what you\u2019d get from a dedicated fitness tracker.\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds 2\n$279 $199 at Amazon\nOur previous top noise-canceling pick, the QuietComfort Earbuds 2 are still a great choice \u2014 and are often on sale for around $100 less than the Ultra model. We think the Ultra are the better earbuds overall, but the Earbuds 2 are a strong alternative for as long as they remain in stock.\nEarFun Air\n$66 $36 at Amazon","EarFun Air\n$66 $36 at Amazon\nThe original EarFun Air reigned as our top budget earbuds pick for years, only to be dethroned by their successor. They can be found for under $40 these days after coupons, but we think most folks are better off spending a little more for the EarFun Air 2.\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\n$170 From $130 at Amazon\nThe Beats Studio Buds Plus offer very good sound quality and ANC as well as a standout transparent color option, and they\u2019re one of the few Apple-made buds that work equally well across iOS and Android. At their discounted price, they make for a strong AirPods Pro alternative \u2014 particularly for non-iPhone folks \u2014 but they\u2019re held back by a lack of wireless charging and many of the other marquee features you\u2019ll find on Apple\u2019s premium buds.\nJBL Tour Pro 2\n$250 at JBL","JLab JBuds Air ANC True Wireless\n$70 at Target\nYou\u2019re not going to find anything groundbreaking in these \u2018buds, but for most people, that\u2019s probably just fine. The sound quality is middle of the road out of the box, with an active bass boost option and decent EQ modes when you click a button on the earbuds.\nThe battery life is also weak at just three hours \u2014 but, on the bright side, they offer good sound isolation from the wind and are rated at IP55 for dust- and water-resistance, which make them a solid choice as budget workout earphones.\nMicrosoft Surface Earbuds\n$250 $200 at Amazon\nThe Surface Earbuds performed well in our testing and real-world usage. You\u2019ll get stable connectivity, a unique circular disc-like design, and eight hours of battery life.

Microsoft super fans who use the 365 suite daily will be impressed by dictation and other integrated features.\nOnePlus Buds Z2\n$60 $50 at Amazon","OnePlus Buds Z2\n$60 $50 at Amazon\nThe OnePlus Buds Z2 offer a lot for under $100, including impressive active noise cancellation, an IPX4 waterproof case and a robust companion app with lots of sound customization features. However, we found its audio quality and battery life to be just OK, and many of its key features are limited to those with OnePlus phones.\nRazer Hammerhead True Wireless Earbuds (2021)\n$130 $70 at Razer\nIf you really want wireless earbuds that have RGB lighting, the Razer Hammerhead are about the only game in town. These earbuds offer decent sound quality and battery life for the price, but we found the controls to be finicky, and the audio to be not quite on par with our favorites from Apple, Sony, Samsung and others.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds Pro\nFrom $90 (Renewed) at Amazon\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds Pro offer up a ton of great software features that let Android users fine-tune the audio and customize the controls on their Samsung devices, and deliver some very solid noise cancellation.","The Beats Fit Pro are our favorite workout earbuds thanks to their secure, sweat-resistant design, AirPods Pro-level feature set and smooth compatibility with both Android and Apple devices.\nThe EarFun Air 2 are the best sub-$50 earbuds we\u2019ve tested, offering excellent audio quality, lots of useful features and a slick design for a bargain price. You can save a total of 30% off these buds by checking the coupon on Amazon and using our exclusive code EAIR2CNN. The code is also usable at EarFun.\nHow we tested\nWe test every pair of wireless earbuds primarily by using them the same way an everyday consumer would. That includes using them as our main headphones for roughly a week, which gives us a sense of how well they hold up for our usual playlists and podcasts \u2014 as well as personal and work calls \u2014 in all sorts of environments that range from our home office to a crowded subway train.","Samsung Galaxy Buds Live\n$87 at Amazon\nThe Galaxy Buds Live were a former recommendation for the most comfortable earbuds, and they still largely live up our original assessment, with a unique bean-shaped design that\u2019s ergonomic and easy to forget about during long hours of listening to music and podcasts. However, newer models are more comfortable and sound better, and noise-canceling technology has improved markedly. We suggest looking at the superior Galaxy Buds Pro, but the Buds Live are worth considering if you\u2019re on a tighter budget.\nSkullcandy Dime 2\n$30 $28 at Amazon","Denon Perl Pro\n$349 at Amazon\nDenon\u2019s flagship true wireless earbuds pack a ton of under-the-hood smarts, with Apple-style fit testing, multipoint support, aptX support for high resolution Bluetooth audio, custom EQ tailored for the user and an app that gives you simple to use fine control of almost every feature from transparency mode levels to touch control options. It\u2019s a compelling package, and they sound very good out of the box. That said, repeatedly running the custom EQ didn\u2019t get us better sound than the flat setting, noise canceling was about on par with other flagships and they are bulky by comparison. Unless you really want specific support for aptX in a high-end earbud or enjoy the extra configuration options, we\u2019d suggest saving $100 and going for the AirPods Pro or Sony WF-1000XM5.\nEarFun Free Earbuds\n$39 From $30 at Amazon","When testing any pair of earbuds, we compare them against similarly priced competitors (AirPods Pro vs. the latest high-end Sony buds, for example) and note how they stack up in key metrics such as sound quality, active noise cancellation and battery life. We also factor in how well a pair of earbuds work on both iOS and Android (many buds favor one over the other) as well as important day-to-day usability things like comfort, controls and how convenient \u2014 and pocketable \u2014 the charging case is.\nOther true wireless earbuds we tested\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds\n$299 at Bose\nWe loved the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds for their stylish and unique clip-on design that allows ambient noise to naturally flow through while still pumping out excellent audio quality.

The sound was fine \u2014 not terrible \u2014 but lacked bass on some of our favorite dance and disco songs. The highs were also a little too overwhelming, creating an overall lack of balance in sound quality. Poor battery life and poor call quality make matters worse, and though sometimes you can justify lack of performance when a headphone looks cool (an area where Skullcandy typically excels), these earbuds are small and unobtrusive, and far from a fashion statement.\nSony WF-1000XM4 Earbuds\nFrom $170 at Amazon\nSony\u2019s WF-1000XM4 buds block out noise in a way that few other earbuds can match \u2014 only bested by Bose\u2019s latest earbuds and their successors in the XM5.

{"neg":["-\nIncorrect Audio Format: Sometimes, the sound format might not be compatible with your headphones. This incompatibility can prevent the sound from being played through the headphones.\n-\n3. Muted Headphones\nAccidental Muting: It's easy to accidentally hit the mute button, especially on headphones with touch controls.\n-\nSoftware Muting: Sometimes, the muting might occur within the computer's sound settings. An accidental click or a software glitch can lead to this issue.\n-\n4. Outdated Audio Drivers\nOld Drivers: Drivers act as translators between the hardware (headphones) and the software (your computer's operating system). If they're outdated, they might not communicate effectively with your current system.\n-\nCorrupted Drivers: Sometimes, drivers can become corrupted due to malware or other software conflicts. This corruption can prevent the drivers from functioning properly.\n-","-\nIncompatible Drivers: If you've recently upgraded your operating system, the old drivers might not be compatible with the new version. This incompatibility can lead to a failure in communication between the headphones and the computer.\n-\n5. Bluetooth Connection Problems\nRange Issues: Bluetooth headphones have a limited range within which they can connect to a device. If you move out of this range, the connection may be lost.\n-\nCompatibility Issues: Not all Bluetooth headphones are compatible with all devices. If the headphones and the device don't support the same Bluetooth version or profiles, they may not connect properly.\n-\nInterference: Other electronic devices or Wi-Fi networks can interfere with the Bluetooth signal, causing connection problems.\n-\n6. Incompatible Wired Hardware Connections\nMismatched Ports and Plugs: If the headphones' plug doesn't match the device's port, they won't connect properly. For example, a USB-C plug won't fit into a standard USB port.\n-","4. Inspect for Physical Damage\nPhysical damage to the headphones can disrupt the audio signal. Carefully inspect the cable, jack plug, or speakers for any visible damage. Look for signs of wear, fraying, or breakage, especially near the plug or earpieces. If you find any damage, like the headphone left side not working, you might need to replace the damaged part or the entire headphones. Many times, physical damage is the root cause of the problem, and identifying it can lead to a quick solution.\n5. Manage Bluetooth Settings","5. Manage Bluetooth Settings\nBluetooth connection problems can be a common issue with wireless headphones. If your Bluetooth headphones are not connecting, try forgetting the device in your Bluetooth settings and then reconnecting. Also, ensure that both the device and the headphones support the same Bluetooth version, as different versions might not be compatible. Checking for and removing any obstacles or sources of interference that might be affecting the Bluetooth signal can also help in establishing a stable connection.\n6. Use an Audio Troubleshooter\nMany operating systems come with built-in audio troubleshooters that can be a valuable tool in diagnosing and fixing common audio problems. Running the troubleshooter will allow it to automatically detect and fix issues that might be preventing your headphones from working. This can include problems with the audio drivers, settings, or other underlying issues that might not be immediately apparent.\n7. Check for Windows Update Conflicts"],"pos":["2. Update or Reinstall Audio Drivers\nAudio drivers act as a bridge between your headphones and your computer. If they're outdated or corrupted, they might not communicate effectively. You can head to the device manager on your computer, find the audio drivers, and right-click to update or uninstall them. After restarting your computer, the drivers will automatically update or reinstall. This process can often resolve any conflicts or issues that were preventing the headphones from working.\n3. Adjust Sound Settings\nThe sound settings on your device play a crucial role in ensuring that the audio is directed to your headphones. Open the sound settings on your device and make sure the correct output device is selected. If your headphones are not the default device, the sound might be sent elsewhere. Also, check the volume levels and ensure that the headphones are not muted. Sometimes, a simple adjustment to these settings can bring your headphones back to life.\n4. Inspect for Physical Damage","7. Check for Windows Update Conflicts\nWindows updates are designed to improve and secure your system, but sometimes they can cause conflicts with existing audio drivers or settings. If you notice that your headphones stopped working after a recent Windows update, you might need to roll back the update or adjust the settings that were changed. Checking the updated notes or consulting online forums can provide insights into any known conflicts and solutions.\n8. Try a Different Port or Device\nSometimes, the problem might not be with the headphones themselves but with the port or the device you are connecting them to. Trying a different port can help you determine if the issue is with the port itself. If the headphones work in a different port or on a different device, the problem is likely with the original port or device. In that case, you may need to consult the device's support or manual for further assistance.\n9.

Update Software\nIf you're using headphones and you find that the sound isn't as loud as you would like, there's a simple way to fix that. To make headphones louder on PC, all you need to do is to update your software.\nHere's how to do it:\nStep 1: Connect your headphones to your computer.\n-\nStep 2: Open the \"Settings\" application on your computer.\n-\nStep 3: Select \"Sound\" from the list of options.\n-\nStep 4: Click on the \"Output\" tab.\n-\nStep 5: Select \"Headphones\" from the drop-down menu.\n-\nStep 6: Click on the \"Apply\" button.\n-\nYour headphones should now be louder.

Check for Obstructions","Another way to make your headphones louder in the settings is by adjusting the volume on your music player. Most music players have a volume control that can be increased or decreased. If you are using your headphones with a computer, you can also adjust the volume by going to the sound settings in your control panel.\n3. Check the Equalizer\nIf you're looking for ways to make your headphones louder, one of the first things you should check is your equalizer settings. An equalizer is a tool that allows you to adjust the sound of your music to better suit your preferences. In some cases, it can make a big difference in how loud your headphones are.","1. Use an Amplifier to Boost Headphone Volume\nIf you're looking for a safe way to make your headphones louder, you may want to consider using an amplifier. Amplifiers can provide a significant boost to the volume of your headphones, and they can also improve the sound quality.\nWhen using headphones, the power from the amp inside your phone, tablet, or laptop might not be sufficient to drive the headphones to their full potential. However, by using an external headphone amp, the sound will not only be louder but also clearer, with a better dynamic range and more detailed music.\n2. Check the Settings\nMany headphones have a built-in amplifier that can be turned on or off. If your headphones have this feature, make sure it is turned on. You can usually find the switch on the side of the headphone jack. Also, consider checking the settings on your music player to make sure the headphones are set as the default output device.","To access the equalizer on your device, you'll first need to find the settings menu. This is usually located in the main menu of your device, but it can vary depending on your specific model. Once you've found the settings menu, look for the equalizer settings and adjust them according to your preferences. You may need to experiment a bit to find the ideal settings, but once you do, you'll likely notice a significant difference in how loud your headphones are.\n4. Use a Volume Boosting App\nNo matter which type of smartphone you have, there are apps available that can help boost the volume of the sound output. Some of these apps are free, while others are not. This can be especially useful if you find that your device's internal speakers aren't loud enough for your needs.\nHere is how to make your music louder on iPhone headphones or Android audio devices:","Here is how to make your music louder on iPhone headphones or Android audio devices:\nDownload the volume-boosting app.Once you download and install the app, open it and follow the instructions.

Use foam tips\nFoam earplugs can help increase the volume of your headphones by up to 10 decibels. They work by sealing off your ear canal, which prevents outside noise from interfering with the sound of your headphones.\nFoam earplugs are relatively inexpensive and can be found at most drugstores. They're also easy to use - just insert them into your ear canal and you're ready to go. If you want to make your headphones even louder, you can try using two sets of earplugs.\n6.

Typically caused by movement during the night, frizziness and fraying is kept to a minimum with a silk headband or pillowcase, as hair is able to move freely over the smooth surface.\n3) Keeps hair hydrated\nMaterials such as cotton tend to absorb more moisture from your hair, resulting in dry locks and weaker hair. Silk helps to lock in natural oils and moisture within the hair, preventing oil depletion. As a result, your hair will also be much cleaner as, unlike silk, cotton will absorb dirt, re-exposing your hair to these impurities time and time again.\n4) Prevents kinks and creases","4) Prevents kinks and creases\nWhen using a non-silk headband over a prolonged period, the harsh materials can create creases in the hairline. Silk is a lightweight yet durable material that even with prolonged use will not leave any unwanted marks on your hair. This makes silk headbands an ideal choice for everyday use for styling.\n5) Breathable fabric\nSilk is lightweight, and whilst it acts as a moderate insulator, heat can escape through it. This keeps your scalp cool, so that your hair can breathe.This helps avoid excess oil production, promotes circulation and is perfect for both summer use and for sleeping as it prevents perspiration from getting trapped at the root.

During my use with AAC and noise cancellation enabled occasionally, I got slightly over 4 hours in about 70% volume, which is decent.\nWith noise cancellation fully off, it lasted for close to 7 hours. For calls, it lasts only for around 4 hours with ANC enabled, since it uses call noise cancellation tech. The Buds Pro was slightly better when it comes to battery.\nWith the 460mAh charging case, it promises up to 35.5 hours of total battery life without ANC and 24 hours of total battery life with noise cancellation enabled. You can\u2019t expect wireless charging in the range. Charging the case fully with the earbuds takes about 1 and half hours. It also has fast charge, so that you get 6.5 hours of playback without ANC with 10 minutes of charging.\nConclusion","You can switch between noise cancellation, transparency and no noise cancellation with tap and hold gesture.\nThis also has Transparency mode that allows you to listen to ambient sound so that you can recognize the surrounding situation and any potential risks. Just like ANC, the transparency mode is also average compared to the Buds Pro. The low-latency gaming mode, which is called low lag mode, works automatically with the Nothing phones, but you need to enable it from the settings for other devices. Without the low lag mode, the latency is too high, but it is decent with the mode enabled, but the company doesn\u2019t reveal the value officially.\nComing to the call noise cancellation, it uses Clear Voice Technology and an advanced wind noise reduction algorithm to ensure crisp, clear calls. This worked well for calls and cuts out the wind noise easily.\nBattery Life","It features five equalizer presets \u2013 Direc Opteo, Rock, Electronic, Pop, Classical and Enhance vocals. \u2013 so that every song can be heard how it should. You can also create custom EQ with the custom option. It doesn\u2019t have the Personal Sound Profile feature present in the Ear series.\nNoise Cancellation and Call Performance\nRegarding the Noise cancellation, the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) blocks the ambient sound up to 42dB, slightly less than 45dB in the Buds Pro. However, the quality in the Ear series felt better, especially when using outdoors.\nHowever, this uses a wide frequency range of up to 2900 Hz, compared to 5000 Hz in the Bud Pro and the premium Ear series, so the cancellation is not the best in varied sound conditions like switching from traffic or crowded areas.\nThis also lacks modes for noise cancellation, so you can just switch between noise cancellation, transparent mode and turn it off.","Opening the case, you can see the earbuds. The case has magnets, so that it locks securely. There is also a magnet connecting the two parts of the case, and the earbuds also have a strong magnet that secures them in its place.\nYou can see the LED light on the front. The USB Type-C port is present on the back, with the function key next to it for pairing.\nThe in-ear earbuds have a matte finish for the stem, and the rest of the earbuds feature a glossy finish. The earbuds weigh about 4.57 grams, which is actually 0.2 grams lighter than the Buds Pro, and measures 32.6 x 20.4 x 24.4mm. There are two mics on each earbud, which promise better wind noise cancellation.\nThere is an optical sensor for wear detection so that it can automatically pause the audio when you remove it from your ears and play when you put it back.","Conclusion\nOverall, CMF Buds is decent active noise cancellation (ANC) TWS earbuds if you are tight on the budget. The design and build are better than the Buds Pro, and the battery life is decent as well, but the ANC is better in the CMF Bud Pro model which is now available at the same Rs. 2,499 price tag.\nIt will be available at a special launch price of Rs. 2,299, during the limited drop sale on Flipkart and Myntra.

{"neg":["Notably, Apple's AirPods don't use Bluetooth 5.0. They use Bluetooth 4.2 and the special Apple W1 chip for an improved connection. On Android, Bluetooth 5.0 should help make Bluetooth headphones something you'd want to use.\nDual Audio\nBluetooth 5.0 also enables a cool new feature that allows you to play audio on two connected devices at the same time. In other words, you could have two pairs of wireless headphones connected to your phone, and them stream audio to both of them at once, all via standard Bluetooth. Or you could play audio on two different speakers in different rooms. You could even stream two different audio sources to two different audio devices at the same time, so two people could be listening to two different pieces of music, but streaming from the same phone."],"pos":["Bluetooth Low Energy for Wireless Headphones (and More)\nImportantly, all the improvements being made to Bluetooth are to Bluetooth Low Energy specification, which was introduced back with Bluetooth 4.0, and not to the classic Bluetooth radio that uses more power. Bluetooth Low Energy is designed to reduce the energy usage of Bluetooth peripherals. It was originally used for wearables, beacons, Bluetooth trackers, and other low-power devices, but had some serious restrictions.\nFor example, wireless headphones couldn't communicate over Bluetooth Low Energy, so they had to use the more power-hungry Bluetooth classic standard instead. With Bluetooth 5.0, all audio devices communicate over Bluetooth Low Energy, which means reduced power usage and longer battery life. Many more types of devices will be able to communicate over Bluetooth Low Energy in the future.","This feature is known as \"Dual Audio\" on the Samsung Galaxy. Just connect two Bluetooth audio devices to your phone, turn on the Dual Audio feature, and you're ready to go. However, this shouldn't be a Samsung-only feature. It's enabled by Bluetooth 5.0 and will hopefully appear on other manufacturers' devices, too.\nMore Speed, Distance, and Throughput\nBluetooth 5.0's primary benefits are improved speed and greater range. In other words, it's faster and can operate over greater distances than older versions of Bluetooth.\nThe official Bluetooth marketing material from the Bluetooth standard organization advertises that Bluetooth 5.0 has four times the range, two times the speed, and eight times the broadcasting message capacity of older versions of Bluetooth. Again, these improvements apply to Bluetooth Low Energy, ensuring devices can take advantage of them while saving power.","With Bluetooth 5.0, devices can use data transfer speeds of up to 2 Mbps, which is double what Bluetooth 4.2 supports. Devices can also communicate over distances of up to 800 feet (or 240 meters), which is four times the 200 feet (or 60 meters) allowed by Bluetooth 4.2. However, walls and other obstacles will weaken the signal, as they do with Wi-Fi (although a better wireless router will help things).\nThe aptX compression standard already promises CD quality audio over lower 1 Mbps speeds, so 2 Mbps speeds should enable even better wireless audio quality.\nTechnically, devices can actually choose between more speed or a longer range. That \"two times the speed\" benefit is helpful when operating at short range and sending data back and forth. The increased range would be optimal for Bluetooth beacons and other devices that only need to send a small amount of data or can send the data slowly, but want to communicate at greater distances. Both are low energy.","iPhone users can get a good experience with Apple's own AirPods or Beats headphones thanks to the W1 chip, but solid Bluetooth audio is easier to get on Android now, too. Bluetooth 5.0 should even improve wireless headphones on the iPhone if you choose to go for third-party Bluetooth 5.0 headphones instead of Apple headphones with a W1 chip.\nWe don't recommend upgrading every last little thing, however. Even if you have a Bluetooth 5.0-enabled laptop, for example, upgrading to a Bluetooth 5.0-enabled mouse probably won't be a big improvement. But, as support for Bluetooth 5.0 finds its way into every new Bluetooth device, Bluetooth peripherals will get better and Bluetooth will become more reliable and power-efficient.\nImage Credit: foxaon1987\/Shutterstock.com, De Repente\/Shutterstock.com, Torok Tihamer\/Shutterstock.com","Bluetooth 5.0's primary benefits are improved speed and greater range. In other words, it's faster and can operate over greater distances than older versions of Bluetooth.","A new version of the Bluetooth standard means various improvements, but only when used with compatible peripherals. In other words, you won't see any immediate benefit from upgrading to a phone with Bluetooth 5.0 if all your Bluetooth accessories were designed for an older version of Bluetooth. Bluetooth is backwards compatible, however, so you can continue using your existing Bluetooth 4.2 and older devices with a Bluetooth 5.0 phone.

{"neg":["Unlike earbuds or over the ear headphones the open ear design means your ear canal is left open so you can hear the world around you as you pound the pavements or ride the trails. You listen to your music by the truly genius method of bone conduction whilst still being able to hear the world around you.\nThis way of hearing means sound vibrations are carried through your bones to your inner ear instead of via the eardrum.\nWith your ear canal unhindered by tight-fitting earbuds, you can hear ambient sounds around you as you exercise, including cars passing close by and other warning sounds that would be muffled by in-ear earphones.\nThis makes for a safer and more social way of exercising, as you can chat with your running partner while listening to your power playlist.\nAeropex are extremely lightweight thanks to the titanium frame. They hook over the ears and rest on your upper cheekbone for a fit that is comfortable but does not bounce annoyingly when you run.","DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AEROPEX AND Swim\nOne of the big differences between the Aeropex and Swim is that Swim is rated IP68 instead of IP67. If you are looking for wireless headphones for swimming, Swim are perfect for wearing during pool lengths, or a morning in the lake. And as Bluetooth technology cannot pass a signal through water, playing audio content like podcasts and audiobooks from an MP3 source is the way to go while swimming.\nEven if you don't want to swim the Swim are versatile headphones as your audio content is stored as MP3 files rather than using a Bluetooth connection to play audio from your device. For those who want to leave their phone, but not their music behind, Swim is the answer.\nOn the other hand, the IP67 rating means Aeropex is totally sweat, rain and showerproof. Even though it is not as waterproof as Swim, it is still packing the highest waterproof standard compared to most headphones, but we don\u2019t recommend Aftershokz Aeropex for swimming."],"pos":["Rather than using Bluetooth, the Swim headphones are wireless waterproof MP3 headphones, so your phone is not required, making them ideal for swimming or any other sport when you don\u2019t want to carry your phone with you. Simply download your favourite tracks onto the Swim (they come with 4GB of storage, meaning they can hold up to 1,200 songs) and you\u2019re ready to dive in.\nIt holds 8 hours of battery life, which is enough for most long swims (unless you are Ross Edgley). More than just a waterproof mp3 player they are open-ear bone-conduction headphones, meaning your ear canal can hear the world around you. They are fully compatible with swim hats, goggles and earplugs, making for the perfect swim get-up.\nFor fitting tips, check out our blog on how to wear your Swim.\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AEROPEX AND Swim","CAN AFTERSHOKZ Swim BE USED FOR SWIMMING?

Try plugging them in and charging them fully before pairing, even if they say they have some battery left.\n-","-\nBring the headphones closer to your device. If you\u2019re listening to music on an iPad that\u2019s sitting across the room, you might be too far away\u2014or have too many obstructions in its path. \u201cWhile most Bluetooth headphones can be apart by 33 feet to 100 feet, it must be noted that this is in plain sight and without a bunch of other Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals also crowding the airwaves,\u201d explains Cramer. Get closer to the device and move away from other signal-generating electronics to see whether that helps.\n-\nPair individual buds properly. If you have \u201ctrue wireless\u201d or \u201cwirefree\u201d earbuds, many let you listen on just one earbud at a time\u2014but you need to do it a certain way. If you pair both earbuds and just pop one in your pocket, you\u2019ll cause a bad connection between the two, and you may experience stuttering. Check the manual to see the proper procedure for single-bud listening.\n-","Reconnect the earbuds to each other. Often, with true wireless earbuds, one will pair to your phone, then the earbuds will pair to each other, which can cause confusion if they lose that second connection. \u201cReboot your earbuds by putting them into the case, closing the door (if one exists), and waiting 10 seconds before trying again,\u201d says Cramer. \u201cBy powering down and back on your earbuds, it gives them the opportunity to \u201cfind\u201d each other once again and reclaim the parent-child relationship between the left and right earbuds.\u201d\n-\nRe-pair the earbuds. As I mentioned above, true wireless models often have specific pairing methods for single-bud listening, and it\u2019s possible you accidentally paired the secondary bud on its own. Try unpairing the earbuds entirely and re-pairing them. Some earbuds may have a fail-safe hard reset mode if you still can\u2019t get them paired, Cramer says, so check the manual to see what it recommends in this scenario.\n-","-\nDisconnect other devices. I\u2019ve found, on some phones, that Bluetooth audio will distort if my phone is connected to other Bluetooth devices at the same time, like a smartwatch or other set of headphones that isn\u2019t active.

Before you jump to troubleshooting Bluetooth, make sure that static isn\u2019t inherent in the source of your music\u2014maybe you\u2019re listening to a low-bitrate MP3 from your Napster days, or maybe your streaming service has defaulted to a very low-quality setting. Check another pair of headphones\u2014which you should have already done earlier!\u2014and see whether it\u2019s really Bluetooth\u2019s fault. Similarly, says Cramer, make sure your Wi-Fi or cell signal is good. If your internet connection can\u2019t keep up with Spotify, it\u2019ll cut in and out through no fault of your headphones.\n-\nRe-pair the headphones.

The following bands are supported:\nSub-6GHz 5G - 5G NR (Bands n1, n2, n3, n5, n7, n8, n12, n14, n20, n25, n26, n28, n29, n30, n38, n40, n41, n48, n53, n66, n70, n71, n77, n78, n79)\n-\nmmWave 5G - Bands n258, n260, n261\n-\nLTE Bands\nThe iPhone 15 models continue to offer Gigabit LTE with 4x4 MIMO for connecting to LTE networks when 5G is unavailable. The following bands are supported:\nFDD-LTE - Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\n-\nTD-LTE - Bands 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48, 53\n-\nEmergency SOS via Satellite\nAll iPhone 15 models can connect to satellites in emergency situations when cellular and Wi-Fi connections are not available. Apple has designed the new Emergency SOS via satellite feature to allow the iPhone's antennas to connect to satellites operated by Globalstar.","Video Capabilities\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus offer up to 4K video recording at 24, 25, 30, or 60 frames per second. HDR recording, ProRes video, Cinematic mode, Action mode, slo-mo video, and time-lapse are all supported.\nPortrait Mode Update\nApple overhauled Portrait mode with the iPhone 15 lineup, and there is no longer a need to specifically choose Portrait mode before capturing an image.\nYou can now snap a photo and if there is a person or pet, depth information is collected and Portrait mode is enabled automatically with a blurred background effect. This also works if you tap to focus on an area in an image, and you can turn it on or off in the Photos app.\nThe degree of background blur can be adjusted as usual, and you can also shift the focus between objects that are in the scene in the Photos app. Apple says that Portrait images feature more detail and richer color, even in Night mode.\nOther Camera Features","-\nTrue Tone flash - True Tone flash is the built-in flash, and it is designed to match the ambient lighting so it doesn't throw off the white balance of the photo when used. The iPhone 15 flash is brighter and it has more consistent lighting.\n-\nCinematic mode - A video mode that keeps the focus on the main subject that you're filming even as you move.\n-\nAction mode - Enhances image stabilization to improve shaky handheld video.\n-\nPanorama - Captures panoramic shots up to 63 megapixels.\n-\nBurst mode - Allows a series of images to be captured all at once, which is good for high-action shots.\n-\nBattery Life\nThere is a 3,349 mAh battery in the iPhone 15, while the iPhone 15 Plus has a 4,383 mAh battery, both just a bit higher-capacity than the batteries from the respective prior-generation models. The iPhone 15 offers up to 20 hours of battery life for video playback, up to 16 hours for streaming video playback, and up to 80 hours for audio playback.","4K video recording, QuickTake video, slo-mo video, Portrait mode, Portrait Lighting, and the Photographic Styles feature for selectively applying edits are also supported on the front-facing camera.\nDual-Lens Rear Camera\nApple made major improvements to the dual-lens camera system used in the iPhone 15 models, introducing a new 48-megapixel Main camera that is notably better than the 12-megapixel Main camera used in the iPhone 14.\nThe camera features a 26 mm focal length with \u0192\/1.6 aperture that lets in plenty of light for situations where lighting is not optimal. Apple added sensor-shift optical image stabilization for less movement and crisper photos and videos, with the lens supporting both 24-megapixel and 48-megapixel high-resolution images.","On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, the USB-C port is limited to USB 2 transfer speeds of 480 Mb\/s, the same as Lightning. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max support faster USB 3 transfer speeds up to 10 Gb\/s.\nTrueDepth Camera and Face ID\nThe iPhone 15 models continue to use Face ID, Apple's facial recognition system. Face ID is now baked into the Dynamic Island, which functions the same as the notch that was available on the iPhone 14 models.\nFace ID is used across iOS for unlocking the iPhone, allowing access to third-party passcode-protected apps, confirming app purchases, authenticating Apple Pay payments, and more.\nFace ID works through a set of sensors and cameras. A Dot Projector projects tens of thousands of invisible infrared dots onto the surface of the skin to create a 3D facial scan that maps the curves and planes of each face, with the scan read by an infrared camera.","-\nOctober 11 - Added a guide on maximizing iPhone 15 battery life.\n-\nOctober 4 - Updated issues section with info about possible problems with wireless charging pads in BMW vehicles.\n-\nSeptember 29 - Included issues section with details about problems with CarPlay and power banks.\n-\nSeptember 25 - Qualcomm X70 modem confirmed, info added.\n-\nSeptember 22 - Launch info and reviews added.\n-\nSeptember 19 - Roundup filled out with all new iPhone 15 details.\n-\nSeptember 15 - Pre-orders are now live.\n-\nSeptember 13 - Roundup overhauled with finalized details post-launch.\n-","The facial depth map is relayed to the A16 chip where it is transformed into a mathematical model that the iPhone uses to authenticate identity. Face ID works in low light and in the dark, and with hats, beards, glasses, sunglasses, scarves, masks, and other accessories that partially obscure the face.\nFront-Facing Camera\nThe iPhone 15 models include the same 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an \u0192\/1.9 aperture that was available in the iPhone 14 lineup. The front-facing camera has a built-in Retina Flash, and it supports almost all of the same features available in the rear cameras.\nApple has included selfie Night mode, improved Smart HDR 5 integration, Dolby Vision HDR recording, Deep Fusion to bring out fine details, a Photonic Engine that improves low-light performance, and next-generation Portrait mode that lets you take images and turn them into portrait shots later.","Apple last year added a Dynamic Island to the iPhone 14 Pro, replacing the notch at the top of the display, and this year, the pill-shaped Dynamic Island has expanded to the iPhone 15 models. The Dynamic Island takes up less space than the notch, allowing for more viewable display area.\nA set of antenna bands is located at the top and sides of the phone, and there is a power button on the right side and volume buttons and a mute switch on the left. Apple replaced the mute switch with an Action button in the iPhone 15 Pro models, but not the standard iPhone 15 models. Underneath the power button, there's a 5G mmWave antenna, but this is limited to iPhone 15 models sold in the United States.","Speaker holes and a microphone are located on the bottom of the iPhone 15 models, along with another major design change - a USB-C port. The USB-C port replaces the Lightning port as Apple has swapped to USB-C charging technology. In some countries, there is a SIM slot on the iPhone, but the physical SIM has been eliminated in the U.S.\nThe camera bump at the back of the iPhone is largely unchanged, and it features a diagonal lens setup for the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras along with a True Tone flash and a microphone.\nWater and Dust Resistance\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus have an IP68 rating for resistance to water and dust intrusion. The smartphones are able to withstand a depth of up to six meters (19.7 feet) for up to 30 minutes.","It can display everything from Maps directions to timers to Apple Music and the AirPods connection status. It integrates with Live Activities for tracking sports scores, Uber rides, and more right from the top of the iPhone's display without leaving the app you're in, plus it can collapse down or open up when tapped.\nA16 Bionic Chip\nApple is using the same A16 Bionic chip that was in the iPhone 14 Pro models for the iPhone 15 lineup. The A16 has two high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores, offering modest improvements over the A15 chip.\nWith its 6-core CPU and 5-core GPU, the A16 Bionic chip has earned a single-core score of 2522 on Geekbench and a multi-core score of 6397. It is second only to the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models in terms of A-series chip performance.\nNeural Engine and ISP\nThere's an updated 16-core Neural Engine in the A16, and it is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second.","Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, GPS, and Ultra Wideband\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) with 4x4 MIMO, and Bluetooth 5.3. There's an NFC chip with reader mode, and a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip. The new Ultra Wideband chip provides improved spatial awareness, allowing iPhone 15 models to more precisely locate other Apple devices with an Ultra Wideband chip. The chip allows two iPhones to connect to each other at three times the range as before.\nThe Ultra Wideband chip can be used for precision tracking, such as when locating AirTags. It is also used for directional AirDrop and for interactions with the HomePod mini, plus Apple has added a Precision Finding feature for locating friends with an iPhone 15 in a crowded area.\nAs for GPS, the iPhone 15 models support GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, and BeiDou location services.\nMagSafe","Little has changed in terms of specific dimensions. The iPhone 15 measures in at 5.81 inches (147.6 mm) tall and 2.82 inches (71.6 mm) wide, while the iPhone 15 Plus measures in at 6.33 inches (160.9 mm) tall and 3.06 inches (77.8 mm) wide. Both models are 0.31 inches (7.80 mm) thick, with the iPhone 15 weighing 6.02 ounces (171 grams) and the iPhone 15 Plus weighing 7.09 ounces (201 grams).\nThe iPhone 15 models feature an all-glass front and a colorful, matte glass back that is framed by a color-matched aerospace-grade aluminum frame. Available colors include black, blue, green, yellow, and pink. This year, Apple used a new process to infuse color throughout the back glass, and it has been strengthened with what Apple describes as a \"dual-ion exchange process.\" There is no (PRODUCT)RED model at the current time, and that's perhaps something we could see released next year.","With the 24-megapixel option, every two pixels are combined into one pixel, allowing for high-resolution images that have impressive detail and low-light performance without too large of a file size. 48-megapixel images are also supported, and this year, can be saved in either RAW or HEIF format.\nThe upgrade to the 48-megapixel lens allowed Apple to add a 2x Telephoto option that uses the middle 12 megapixels on the sensor for full-resolution 2x photos with no digital zoom. There is no optical zoom lens on the iPhone 15, and this is the first time Apple has enabled any kind of optical zoom option on a standard iPhone.\nAlong with the 48-megapixel Main camera, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide camera with an \u0192\/2.4 aperture and 120\u00ba field of view. It is identical to the Ultra Wide camera in the iPhone 14 models.\nVideo Capabilities","The iPhone 15 Plus offers up to 26 hours of video playback, up to 20 hours of streaming video playback, and up to 100 hours of audio playback. All iPhone 15 models are fast-charge capable and can charge up to 50 percent in 30 to 35 minutes with a 20W or higher power adapter.\niPhone 15 models show the battery cycle count for the first time, and there is also a built-in setting to prevent an iPhone from charging past 80 percent to preserve battery health.\n5G Connectivity\nThe iPhone 15 models are equipped with a next-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon X70 modem that supports 5G connectivity. Qualcomm says that the X70 modem features the first 5G AI system in a modem system, using AI to enable faster 5G speeds, better coverage, lower latency, and improved power efficiency.","The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus start at $799 and offer a good balance between functionality, longevity, and price, but if cost is the major factor for you, Apple also offers the $429 iPhone SE with older technology and the prior-generation iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus with pricing starting at $699. The two-year-old iPhone 13 is also available starting at $599.\nIf you're looking for something more feature rich than the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, you can step up to the iPhone 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max. The respective screen sizes of the Pro models are the same, but they include a number of upgrades such as an Always-On display with ProMotion technology, a customizable Action button instead of a ring\/silent switch on the side, a faster A17 Pro chip, an advanced camera system with telephoto, and more.\nChoosing an iPhone is a major decision, so we have some buyer's guides that walk you through choosing the best device for you, and you'll also want to check out our iPhone deals post to get the best prices.","Display\nCompared to last year's iPhone models, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have the same OLED Super Retina XDR display, but with improvements to brightness for better performance in the sunlight and better HDR. Typical max brightness is now 1000 nits (up from 800), while peak HDR brightness is 1600 nits (up from 1200). Apple also says that the iPhone 15 models can reach 2000 nits peak brightness outdoors, a display feature introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro model last year and expanded to the standard iPhone 15 models this year.\nThe iPhone 15 has a resolution of 2556 by 1179 with 460 pixels per inch, while the iPhone 15 Plus has a resolution of 2796 by 1290 with 460 pixels per inch.","A second-generation Ultra Wideband chip delivers enhanced proximity-based functionality, allowing iPhones to connect to each other at three times the range as before. With Precision Finding in the Find My app, you can track down your friends even in a dense crowd.\nBattery life remains the same on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus compared to their predecessors, with video playback for up 20 hours on the iPhone 15 and 26 hours on the iPhone 15 Plus. As with the last several generations, the iPhone 15 models support 5G connectivity (both sub-6GHz and mmWave in the United States), and they use a new Qualcomm X70 modem. In the United States, iPhone models again ship without a physical SIM card as carriers now use eSIM.","The A16 chip also includes an image signal processor that powers the photographic features of the iPhone 15 models, with up to four trillion operations performed per photo.\nRAM\nThere is 6GB RAM in the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, the same amount of RAM that was in the iPhone 14 models.\nStorage Space\nStorage space starts at 128GB for the most affordable versions of the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, but 256GB and 512GB options are available at increased prices.\nUSB-C Port\nThe iPhone 15 models are the first to feature a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port, allowing them to be charged with a USB-C cable. With this change, the same cord can be used for charging the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C charging case.\nUSB-C allows an iPhone to directly charge AirPods or an Apple Watch using a USB-C cable, and the iPhone is able to provide up to 4.5W.","MagSafe\nThere continue to be MagSafe magnets at the back of the iPhone 15 models, with those magnets able to connect to the MagSafe charger and other magnetic accessories. Official MagSafe chargers from Apple and authorized third parties can wirelessly charge the iPhone 15 models at up to 15W.\nSecond-generation Qi-based charging is also available, but it still maxes out at 7.5W and does not support faster charging.\niPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max\nApple is selling the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus alongside the more expensive iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, which are quite an upgrade this year.\nCompared to the iPhone 15 models, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max feature a lighter, more durable titanium frame, a faster and more efficient A17 Pro chip built on a new 3-nanometer process, ProMotion display technology, an Always-On display, and 3x and 5x Telephoto camera lenses, respectively.\nMore information about the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max can be found in our roundup.\nBeyond the iPhone 15","The swap to USB-C was seen as a positive change, though reviewers were not pleased with the limited USB 2.0 speeds that offer no improvements over Lightning. Changing to Lightning will also require tossing out all Lightning cables, but not having to carry multiple cables for Macs and iPads is a positive.\nWith the 48-megapixel camera for high-resolution photos and the 2x optical zoom option, the iPhone 15 camera is a major improvement that was praised by reviewers.\nWe have a dedicated review roundup with more iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus reviews for those who want additional information.\nDesign\nThe 6.1-inch iPhone 15 and 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus (measured diagonally at the display) have the same general design as the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, but with more contoured edges that change the feel of the devices in the hand and lend a more modern look that sets the new iPhones apart from last year's models.","The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus use the same A16 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, using 20 percent less power and delivering improved performance and 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus.\nCamera improvements include a new 48-megapixel Main camera with a quad-pixel sensor that defaults to capturing 24-megapixel photos. The updated Main camera also allows for a new 2x Telephoto option intelligently cropped from the full camera capture.\nPortraits no longer require switching Portrait mode, with the iPhone 15 automatically capturing depth information when a person, dog, or cat is detected in the frame. The new camera system also brings sharper detail, more vivid colors, and improved low-light performance to portraits, while Night mode sees similar improvements.","The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are each available in five color options: pink, yellow, green, blue, and black. Perhaps the most significant change for the lineup is a move from the Lightning port that has been present on every iPhone for over a decade to a USB-C port, although data transfers on these models remain at the same USB 2.0 speeds that were available with Lightning.\nNew for the non-Pro lineup in 2023 is the Dynamic Island, which debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro lineup a year earlier. The Dynamic Island replaces the previous notch at the top of the display and houses the front-facing TrueDepth camera and other sensors. Software helps hide these physical components inside the black Dynamic Island, which fluidly adapts to display important information and allow for user interaction.","-\nBeyond the iPhone 15\n-\niPhone 15 Roundup Changelog\n-\niPhone 15 Timeline\n-\nThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are Apple's consumer-focused flagship devices with prices starting at $799.

Smaller drivers may also provide better overall clarity and balance in the sound.\nRecommended by LinkedIn\nThat being said, the size of the driver is just one factor that can influence the sound quality of TWS earbuds. Other factors such as the design of the earbuds, the quality of the audio codec, and the tuning of the sound profile can also play important roles in determining the overall sound quality and user experience."],"pos":["A larger driver size, such as 13mm, can generally produce more powerful and impactful bass, as it can move more air than a smaller driver size, such as 10mm.

{"neg":["How to Disconnect Your Headphones\nThe easiest way to disconnect your headphones from a connected device is to simply turn them off. If you use your headphones with multiple devices, it's a good idea to disconnect them from your phone before listening on a laptop, for instance. You can remain paired to multiple devices, but audio quality and connection strength can take a hit.\nWhen you're done listening on a phone, all you need to do is open the Bluetooth menu again and tap the headphones to disconnect. In Windows, click Disconnect next to the headphones in question. Mac users can click the Disconnect button next to the headphones on the Bluetooth menu (Ventura or higher) or right-click the listing and choose Disconnect (Monterey and older).\nHow to Reconnect Your Headphones","How to Unpair (Forget) Bluetooth Headphones\nWhen you pair headphones to a phone or computer, the device remembers them. However, you can also tell that device to forget those headphones if you no longer want to use the two together. If you're having issues connecting and the headphones don't seem to be cooperating, erasing the set from the Bluetooth device list and then re-pairing them can sometimes fix the problem.\nOn an iPhone, open your Bluetooth settings menu and tap the (i) icon next to the name of the headphones, then tap Forget This Device > Forget Device.\nThe process may vary across different Android devices, but generally you should open your Bluetooth or Connected Devices settings, tap the settings gear next to your headphones, and choose Forget or Unpair.\nIn Windows 10, open the Bluetooth setting menu, choose the headphones from the menu, and click Remove device. In Windows 11, you'll have to find your headphones on the Bluetooth page, then click the three-dot menu and choose Remove device.","The process for adding your AirPods will differ if you're connecting them to a Mac or Windows PC.\nIn Windows 10, tap Add Bluetooth or other devices and choose Bluetooth from the menu.\nIn Windows 11, select the Network, Sound, or Battery icons in the taskbar and open Manage Bluetooth devices > Bluetooth. Find the headphones in the menu and click Connect.\nOn a Mac, open System Settings > Bluetooth and click Connect next to the item.\nIf this doesn't work (though it should), just try the whole process again. Typically, you'll see the product name on the list of available pairable products. If you don't see your headphones listed, that may be because manufacturers sometimes use abbreviated nicknames, head-scratching codenames, or the manufacturer's own name to identify their products.\n4. Start Playing Music","How to Reconnect Your Headphones\nSo long as the headphones remain powered on (and within Bluetooth range of 30 feet), many sets can be reconnected simply by pressing the connect button on your device once again. Some Bluetooth headphones will even automatically reconnect with the device they were most recently paired with (such as your phone) when powered on.\nHowever, it's not uncommon for a device to need to be manually re-paired every time you power it back up again. It's annoying, but it's not difficult to manage, and it should be faster than the initial pairing process. Simply open up the Bluetooth menu on your device and select the pair listed on the screen; some sets need to first be put back into pairing mode.\nHow to Unpair (Forget) Bluetooth Headphones","4. Start Playing Music\nOnce you're paired, simply start playing music\u2014it'll now be streaming through your headphones or earphones. Depending on the controls on your particular pair, you'll be able to toggle playback controls, change volume, summon voice assistants, and manage phone calls, directly through the headphones and also on the phone or computer to which you're connected.\nMany headphone makers also have their own equalizer app that will allow you to control audio quality, sound profiles, and noise cancellation settings. If you have AirPods, you can change these options right from the Bluetooth settings menu.\nSo, the bottom line is: No matter whether they're wireless in-ears, headphones, or true wireless models, pairing via Bluetooth is easy. The whole process takes about 10 seconds.\nHow to Disconnect Your Headphones"],"pos":["Some headphones automatically go into pairing mode when powered up. If you have true wireless earbuds, such as Apple's AirPods or anything that comes in a small charging case, you can typically enter pairing mode simply by opening the case and removing the buds. Some sets also have a pairing button for good measure.\n3. Select Your Headphones\nNow go back to the Bluetooth settings screen on your device. On a phone, hold down the Bluetooth button. You should see the name of your headphones among a list of other nearby devices. Select the entry, and you should be paired within seconds.\nIf you have an iPhone, headphones equipped with Apple's W-series or H-series chip, like AirPods or Beats, are even easier to pair. You don't even have to open the Bluetooth menu\u2014an on-screen notification appears when the earphones are close to your phone and they pair almost instantly. Check out our guide for the full instructions.\nThe process for adding your AirPods will differ if you're connecting them to a Mac or Windows PC.","1. Turn on Bluetooth\nFirst, enable Bluetooth in your device's settings menu. On a phone, that means pulling down from the top of the screen to open Android's Quick Settings menu or iPhone's Control Center. Make sure the Bluetooth icon is enabled here.\nIn Windows 10, open Settings > Devices > Bluetooth & other devices and make sure the Bluetooth switch is enabled. On Windows 11, open Settings > Bluetooth & devices and enable Bluetooth. On a Mac, go to System Settings > Bluetooth and enable the Bluetooth option.\n2. Enter Pairing Mode\nYou can now put your headphones or earphones in pairing mode. Press and hold the Bluetooth pairing button on the headset. If you're not sure which button that is, your manual will tell you. Sometimes it's a dedicated button, other times it's the power button.\nOnce you hold down the pairing button for a long enough time (usually a few seconds), the LEDs on the headphones should blink to indicate they're ready to pair with your phone or computer.","Enter Pairing Mode You can now put your headphones or earphones in pairing mode.

There can be a perception that wearing noise-cancelling headphones deals with all distracting noise; whereas, best case, it dampens it. Most noise cancelling aims to reduce hums and other background noise rather than conversations and other less predictable noise. Playing any music or noise has the potential to be damaging to hearing. It can create a division in the workplace. A barrier from the non-work conversation that helps a day go by and builds relationships in an office.

{"neg":["Shokz OpenRun ($129 at Amazon): These are currently the best set of bone conduction headphones for most people, and they\u2019re a rebrand on the famed AfterShokz Aeropex. With the Shokz OpenRun, you get Bluetooth 5.1, 8th-gen bone conduction technology, and fast charging. Unfortunately, you have to deal with the company\u2019s proprietary two-pin connector, but there are worse things.\n-\nShokz OpenRun Pro ($179 at Amazon): If you want the best pair of bone conduction headphones regardless of price, get the OpenRun Pro. These headphones come with a mobile app, and audio output is less likely to change dramatically as jaw movement displaces the OpenRun Pro.\n-\nShokz OpenMove ($79 at Amazon): For the best budget bone conduction headphones from Shokz, I recommend the Open Move. Unlike the company\u2019s other headphones, these charge via USB-C. You get an IP55 dust- and water-resistant build along with multipoint connectivity.\n-\nTo see the rest of your options, check out our list of the best bone conduction headphones.","Like bone conduction headphones, the Bose Sports Open Earbuds (on the product\u2019s website) feature an unoccluded design that leaves your ear canals completely open. You get all the same safety benefits from Bose\u2019s chunky earbuds as you do from a set of bone conduction headphones, but Bose\u2019s earphones sit where your ears meet your skull and use precisely placed speakers to funnel sound down your ear canals. If you have fine hearing abilities and want something to keep you safe, these IPX4 earbuds are a great option. They sound much better than bone conduction and serve a similar purpose for those (without hearing impairments) who need a pair of earbuds that are safe for outdoor use.\nFrequently asked questions about bone conduction headphones\nYes, AfterShokz changed its name to Shokz in December 2021, and has been releasing new headsets under the Shokz name.","What\u2019s more, if you suffer from hearing loss and use hearing aids, bone conduction headphones are a viable option. While conventional earbuds and headphones may interfere with or jostle hearing aids, bone conduction headphones bypass this. Additionally, listeners who are deaf in one ear may enjoy stereo sound that can\u2019t be heard with traditional in-ears. Bone conduction headphones give certain listeners a sense of hearing that may otherwise be unavailable to them.\nBone conduction headphones are great if you live in a city and want to remain aware of traffic while walking or cycling.","Those who fall into this camp believe they\u2019re paying more for less. The concept is novel, but real-world use reveals many deficiencies. Of course, there are always two sides to a coin.\nWhy you should get bone conduction headphones\nAll right, so consumers in favor of bone conduction headphones champion the technology for safety reasons and because it\u2019s beneficial for those who are hard of hearing. Regarding the former, being aware of your surroundings during outdoor workouts is a necessity, especially for runners. Since these don\u2019t seal around or even touch the ear canal, they allow you to hear other pedestrians, passing cars, and other potential hazards.","Unfortunately, no: bone conduction may bypass your outer ear, but needs the inner ear bones, cochlea, and your nerve to work in order for you to hear audio. An acoustic neuroma is a tumor on the nerve bundle that connects these organs to your brain, and if that nerve is severed, there\u2019s no longer a link from the ear to your brain. Bone conduction can\u2019t bypass this.\nThe Aftershokz Aeropex are the best bone conduction headphones: they use Bluetooth 5.0 technology, has an eight-hour battery life, and are IP67-rated. To learn more, check out our list of the best bone conduction headsets.\nIn theory, yes: because your ear canal is unoccluded, outside noise can make it to your inner ear much more easily than it would if you were wearing headphones or in-ears. However, you still need to listen at a responsible volume, as your brain can make it harder for you to hear certain noises if you\u2019re listening to loud music. Remember, auditory masking takes place in your brain, not your ear.","Although audiophiles likely won\u2019t be endorsing bone conduction headphones anytime soon, the fact remains that they serve a purpose for those with impaired hearing. To call them a complete gimmick would be oversimplifying the technology and its various use cases. Yet, to call them the best thing since the TRRS plug would be a severe exaggeration. Plenty of great wireless earbuds provide better audio quality if your hearing ability is unimpaired. If you are someone who experiences hearing loss, bone conduction headphones are a great option.\nHow to wear bone conduction headphones\nProper fit and positioning are essential for getting the best audio experience and avoiding discomfort when using bone conduction headphones. Here are some tips:\nPosition the transducers: Locate the flat transducer surfaces that rest against your skull, typically in front of your ears. Position them snugly against the bony areas in front of your ears, just above your jawbone.\n-","This depends on the design of your hearing aid. If you have in-the-ear (ITE) or invisible (IIC) hearing aids, you should be able to use bone conduction headphones with hearing aids without issue. However, if you have behind-the-ear (BTE), receiver-in-canal (RIC), or open-fit hearing aids, you could experience some discomfort when wearing bone conduction headphones because they may make contact with the top part of the hearing aid module.\nUnfortunately, bone conduction headphones get sound to your inner ear by vibrating the bones removed in your surgery, so it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll work for you.\nYes. Earplugs physically block the entrance to the ear canal, while bone conduction headphones work by sending vibrations to the bones in your inner ear. In theory, this should work, though you would lose out on the advantages of bone conducting headphones.","Although bone conduction headphones bypass the eardrum, they still have to transmit vibrations to the inner ear for your cochlea to receive and funnel to the brain via stereocilia vibrations. Therefore, they still must emit the same frequencies and vibrations to reach your cochlea, meaning some sound will be heard by those around you due to the lack of seal.\nTinnitus typically is a product of the brain in response to hearing loss. Bone conduction headphones won\u2019t cure your tinnitus, but they\u2019re safe to use.\nThis will depend on the extent of the sensitivity and the specific model. Bone conduction headphones still attach to your head or your ears."],"pos":["What's more, if your eardrum isn't being used, transmission accuracy is compromised. You'll get the gist of your media playback, but the audio quality is severely degraded. If audio quality matters to you at all, avoid bone conduction cans. Sound quality aside, the fit may be uncomfortable.","Why you shouldn\u2019t get bone conduction headphones\nBone conduction nay-sayers harp on the importance of isolation, but it\u2019s more than repetition for the sake of repetition; it makes an audible difference. Insulating your eardrums from outside clamor benefits clarity because a good seal mitigates auditory masking. What\u2019s more, if your eardrum isn\u2019t being used, transmission accuracy is compromised. You\u2019ll get the gist of your media playback, but the audio quality is severely degraded.\nIf audio quality matters to you at all, avoid bone conduction cans.\nSound quality aside, the fit may be uncomfortable. Let\u2019s take the Aftershokz Trekz Titanium, one of the more popular options; it rests atop your cheekbones and balances its weight on a small portion of your ears. It\u2019s hard to maintain a stable fit when walking, let alone when doing more vigorous activities like running."],"query":"Why bone conduction headphones are not popular?"}

I just rolled with the standard medium ones to see what would happen.\nA few days in, though, I ran into the same fit issues I had experienced with the first-gen Pros. They just kept falling out, which shouldn\u2019t have been a surprise, given the design is essentially identical to the original AirPods Pro (and because I stuck with the medium eartip out of pure laziness). When I popped in the extra small eartips, I didn\u2019t expect them to make a difference. Now, the AirPods Pro fit better than they ever have.","Video calls are no longer a game of \u201chow few times can I poke my own ears.\u201d I can happily chew my food without preparing to catch a falling headphone. On runs, I can focus on steps and music instead of the headphones in my ears.\nTechnically, the extra small eartips are only for the second-gen Pros\nMore than a month on, the smaller eartips are easily my favorite upgrade with the AirPods Pro. But if you want them for yourself, technically the best way to get them is by dropping the $249 for a brand new pair of the second-gen headphones, as Apple says that its eartips \u201chave been designed specifically for their AirPods Pro generation.\u201d But as my colleague Chris Welch found, tips fit either version of the earbuds, so you could also try buying a set of $7.99 replacements for the second-gen Pros and sticking them on your older pair of buds.","My favorite change to the new AirPods Pro is perhaps the smallest one.

{"neg":["Active Noise Cancellation\nIf you\u2019re not aware of this term, I'll quickly explain it so you\u2019ll have a better idea of what I\u2019m referring to in this section.\nActive Noise Cancellation, or ANC as it's often referred to, is an electronic feature that\u2019s built into some headsets that acts as a countermeasure to ambient room noise. Sometimes noise in our work environment can be distracting, and prevent us from staying focused.\nANC allows you to apply some controls over how much of that room noise you hear. When you activate this feature, the noise is blocked out so you can stay focused on your work. With that in mind, here\u2019s a quick comparison on how these two headsets compare.\nThe Evolve 75, and the Evolve2 75 both have ANC, but there are some differences.\nThe Jabra Evolve 75 ANC is an on\/off feature.","Jabra has done a magnificent job to give you a comfortable wearing experience with the Evolve2 75. The design of this headset clearly lends itself to comfort, and the way the headband has been designed really helps to give you a comfortable fit. Add to that, the acoustically designed ear cups, and memory foam ear pads, and it's easy to see that Jabra succeeded in making a headset you can wear for long periods of time comfortably. And for anyone who spends their day on calls, these new design elements on the Evolve2 75 really make a difference.\nMicrophone Comparison\nThe Jabra Evolve 75 has a noise cancelling uni-directional ECM microphone that can be placed on the right or left side.","For the past four years, the Jabra Evolve 75 has been a highly popular headset, and for several good reasons.\nThe Evolve 75 is Lightweight\n-\nIt has a great sounding microphone\n-\nIt comes with Active Noise Cancellation for maintaining focus\n-\nIt can be used as a wired or wireless headset\n-\nThe Evolve 75 has a built-in busy light\n-\nThe microphone boom arm magnetically attaches to the side of the headband to keep it out of the way when a microphone isn't needed.\n-\nThe color scheme used on the Evolve 75 is a matt black with red accents, and though that made for a great looking headset at the time, it\u2019s become dated in appearance.\nThe new Jabra Evolve2 75 has eliminated the red accents in favor of a more stealthy black, almost Darth Vader type look. The updated appearance makes it look far more contemporary over the Evolve 75.\nHere are some things to consider when comparing these two headsets.\nWireless Range","Here are some things to consider when comparing these two headsets.\nWireless Range\nBoth headsets are stated to provide up to 100 feet (30 meters) of wireless range. So, you should expect both to provide you with an equal amount of distance to walk and talk. Neither headset has an advantage here, but the amount of wireless range you should expect really comes down to your environment, and the type, and number of obstructions because obstructions are known to reduce wireless range.\nWeight - Heavyweight, Lightweight or something in between\nThe Jabra Evolve 75 weighs 6.25 ounces.\nThe Evolve2 75 weighs 6.9 ounces.\nThere's really not enough of a weight difference to give an advantage to either of these models.","-\nEvolve2 65 vs. Evolve2 75 vs. Evolve2 85\nIf you\u2019d like to watch a comparison video we recorded that compares the Jabra Evolve2 65, Evolve2 75, and the Evolve2 85, I\u2019ll post it below.

Simply slide the boom arm up, and into the cavity, and it\u2019s now out of the way for those times when you\u2019re not on a call, and don't need the use of a microphone.\nIf you\u2019d like to hear how both of these headsets sound with no background noise, with office noise, dogs barking, wind, and of course, no sound test would be complete if it didn\u2019t include our signature noisy, annoying blender test, make sure to check out my video here.\nBluetooth version\nThe Jabra Evolve 75 uses Bluetooth 4.2, where the Evolve2 75 uses Bluetooth 5.2.","Active Noise Cancelation (ANC)\nEvolve 75 - yes\nEvolve2 75 - yes, with enhanced ear cup design for improved noise control.\nHear surroundings w\/o removing headset\nEvolve 75 - yes, via the Listen-In feature\nEvolve2 75 - yes, via the HearThrough feature\nWarranty\nEvolve 75 - 2 years\nEvolve2 75 - 2 years\nPricing - Jabra MSRP\nEvolve 75 - $355.00\nEvolve2 75 - $403.00\nMore details below\nIf you're looking at both of these headsets and aren't sure which one to choose, then the following information should be helpful.

Weight does matter, there\u2019s no denying that. But, comfort also involves other things such as design, the type of materials used, size of ear cushions, amount and type of padding, the type of headband and how it's designed, and the amount and type of padding used on the headband.\nThe Evolve 75 is a comfortable headset which is only partly why this has been such a popular headset. The Evolve2 75 is also a comfortable headset, but if I had to choose one over the other, I'd take the newer, Evolve2 75 simply due to its improved design because from a weight perspective, they both weigh about the same. So it comes down to how the headset is designed, and the materials used which work together to deliver a comfortable wearing experience. And from that point of view, I give the Evolve2 75 my enthusiastic nod."],"query":"What is the difference between evolve and Evolve2?"}

That said, not everyone will find them comfortable.","Their five-hour continuous battery life is short compared to similarly priced headphones like the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3. Their carrying case supplies roughly 2.6 extra charges, but you might prefer the Samsung Galaxy Buds FE Truly Wireless if you want a slightly longer battery life.

They use Samsung Scalable codec instead of the Samsung Seamless codec and come in at a cheaper price.\n-","Their battery lasts almost nine hours of continuous use, so they can last through a workday, and their case stores an additional three charges. Their auto-off timer will also save battery life if you forget to stick them back in the case.

They have a decently comfortable, stable fit, although they sit somewhat deep in your ears, which can create a plunger-like feeling when you remove the buds.\nIf you want aptX connectivity without compromising durability, the Jabra Elite 3 True Wireless are worth a look, although they can be a little more expensive.

They have a shallower silicone ear tip design, which puts less pressure on your ear canal for better comfort. The trade-off is that they block less high-pitched noise but still do a solid job of filtering out low- and mid-frequency noises like rumbling bus engines or ambient chatter. While they don't support Sony's proprietary LDAC, they can use aptX Adaptive, a codec that dynamically adjusts your audio content, providing either lower or higher latency for streaming video or better audio quality.

They don't support LDAC, and their ANC feature doesn't block out as much ambient noise, so they aren't ideal for loud situations like commuting or walking on a busy street. However, they support aptX Adaptive, which is great for balancing the connection strength with the audio quality and multi-device pairing. Also, the ANC still does an excellent job of isolating you from unwanted disturbances. The fit is pretty subjective, but these earbuds stick out of your ears and use different-sized stability fins (which can feel secure or apply too much pressure).

{"neg":["The mic array offers solid intelligibility. Using the Voice Memos app on an iPhone, we could understand every word we recorded, but the mic array favors boosted clarity over accuracy, so the signal can sound a little filtered in favor of high-mids. Callers will have no problem understanding you on a clear cell or wireless signal.\nThe Leader In Noise Cancellation","On Jay-Z and Kanye West\u2019s \u201cNo Church in the Wild,\u201d the kick drum loop receives plenty of high-mid presence so that its attack retains its punch. We also hear the vinyl hiss and crackle, usually relegated to the background, take a step forward in the mix. The sub-bass synth hits that punctuate the beat are delivered with substantial bass depth, but nothing like we hear on seriously bass-boosted models that are going for the full subwoofer sound. The vocals are delivered cleanly on this track, with perhaps a bit of added sibilance.\nOrchestral tracks, like the opening scene from John Adams\u2019 The Gospel According to the Other Mary, sound balanced despite the sculpting in the lows and highs. The higher-register brass, strings, and vocals retain their bright, prominent presence in the mix, while the lower-register instrumentation takes a step forward without overwhelming the balance.","Bill Callahan\u2019s \u201cDrover,\u201d a track with far less deep bass in the mix, gives us a better sense of the QuietComfort 45\u2019s general sound signature. The drums on this track get some added bass thump, but nothing overly thunderous. Callahan\u2019s baritone vocals have a rich low-mid presence well matched with high-mids that add some crispness to the delivery. The higher-register percussive hits and acoustic guitar also benefit from the frequency sculpting. The sound signature isn\u2019t wildly tweaked, but it\u2019s massaged enough that we wouldn\u2019t call it flat response.","Loud music with deep bass, bright guitars, and percussion, also played at high volumes through the near-field monitors, gets similarly dampened to an impressive degree. The ANC doesn't come close to completely eliminating these high-volume sounds, but it's doubtful any noise-cancelling circuitry can. In a real-life scenario, the QuietComfort 45 can easily and significantly reduce in-room TV audio or office chatter.\nFor comparison, Sony's WH-1000XM4 headphones deal with powerful low-frequency sounds with similar skill, and it\u2019s hard to say which pair is better. They both dial back large swaths of rumble, but their circuitry is different, so they don\u2019t dial back the exact same frequencies with the exact same results. In the case of mids and highs, the QC 45's ANC is slightly more effective. The Sony headphones let through more high frequencies and seem to dial back the mids to a lesser degree, although the difference is subtle.","Bose eschews capacitive touch controls, instead going with physical buttons, three clustered on the back edge of the right earcup. The central button handles playback, call management, track navigation, and voice assistants (depending on how many times you tap it), and is flanked by dedicated volume up\/down buttons. The left earcup has an ANC\/ambient mode button, which Bose calls Quiet and Aware modes. Unfortunately, Bose only allows you to listen in Quiet or Aware modes; you can't disable both features to preserve battery life. You can use the headphones in passive mode, with the included 3.5mm audio cable, but with many phones lacking a headphone jack these days, this isn't particularly useful.","Compared with the AirPods Max, the Bose headphones fare better against both low rumble and the mids\/highs of a restaurant. The AirPods Max do well, but they can drastically alter the ANC as your head moves. While you might need to tweak the position of the QC 45 on your head to get the best effect with low frequencies, the Bose headphones still consistently dial the lows back regardless of head movement.\nAnd while the QuietComfort headphones don't offer the same the granular ANC adjustments of the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, they're better at tamping down both powerful low frequencies as well as restaurant-like mids and highs. So if you want the best noise cancellation from a pair of Bose headphones, you just have to accept less control over the ability to tweak it.","Aware mode (which lets you hear your surroundings without removing the headphones) is useful, but seems slightly less loud than competing models. Bose ostensibly aims to recreate the actual levels you would hear around you, which is a noble pursuit, but sometimes you might want more volume, or more of the high-mid and high frequencies that make voices more intelligible (especially with music playing).\nQuietComfort 45 Sound Quality\nOn tracks with intense sub-bass content, like The Knife\u2019s \u201cSilent Shout,\u201d the headphones deliver powerful low-frequency response at default settings. At top, unwise listening levels, the bass depth is strong and doesn\u2019t distort. At lower, more moderate listening levels, the bass still feels powerful, and is well matched with higher-frequency sculpting.","A Familiar Design\nAvailable in black or off-white, the circumaural (over-ear) QuietComfort 45 headphones look a lot like the QuietComfort 35 II, with a simple, practical design that prominently displays the Bose logo on the sides. The fit is exceptionally comfortable, with plush earpads and an equally cushioned headband. I wore them for hours of testing and never felt uncomfortable pressure on the top of my head. The headphones have no IP rating and aren't water resistant, but that isn't expected.","Bose estimates battery life to be roughly 24 hours, but your results will vary with your volume levels.\nQuietComfort 45 Noise Cancellation\nQuite simply, the QuietComfort 45 headphones offer the best active noise cancellation we've tested. Deep low-frequency rumble, like you\u2019d hear on an airplane, gets dialed back effortlessly. This is easy for noise-cancelling circuitry, though. ANC headphones tend to struggle much more with variable highs like human conversation and glasses clinking, so we played a recording of a loud, busy restaurant through near-field monitors as a stress test. Impressively, the ANC had no problem in either of these scenarios, tamping down the mids and highs dramatically, as well as dampening the lows. There is perhaps the slightest bit of audible high-frequency hiss (like a faint white noise), but it\u2019s just barely there, and it doesn't mask or impact the ANC performance.","The Leader In Noise Cancellation\nThe QuietComfort 45 headphones cement Bose as the leader in active noise cancellation, with better performance than the $549 AirPods Max, the $349 Sony WH-1000XM4, and Bose's own $379 Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. That said, the QC 45 aren't the best-sounding pair of the bunch, and each competitor offers unique strengths. The AirPods Max deliver unparalleled connectivity with Apple devices, as well as Apple's unique Adaptive EQ and Spatial audio features. Sony's WH-1000XM4 headphones are the best bet for audiophiles. And the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 offer the ability to tune noise cancellation to taste. Each of these pairs brings something to the table and is worth considering. But if it's the absolute best ANC you're after, the QuietComfort 45 headphones are the ones to get, and our Editors' Choice winner for class-leading noise cancellation.","Bose has long dominated the world of noise-cancelling headphones, with its QuietComfort line setting the bar for the industry for over 20 years. Apple and Sony have recently given Bose a run for its money with the AirPods Max and the WH-1000XM4, both of which offer their own excellent active noise cancellation (ANC) with arguably stronger audio quality. And Bose is even competing against itself with the terrific Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, which deliver ANC you can tune to your liking. That means the stakes have never been higher for the company's latest QC headphones, the $329 QuietComfort 45. Simply put, this is the best active noise cancellation you can find in over-ear headphones. The sound quality is good too, and certainly lives up to the price tag, though the aforementioned models are better geared toward audiophiles. But in terms of sheer ANC performance, you won't find a better pair than the QuietComfort 45, earning the headphones our Editors' Choice award.\nA Familiar Design","Once paired, you can use the app to toggle between Quiet and Aware modes, which you can already do on the headphones. You can also connect to different sound sources you're simultaneously paired to, letting you easily get audio from your phone, laptop, or other device. Other than that, the settings menu only provides some basic options, like adjusting automatic power-down times and the level of mic monitoring (how much of your own voice you hear on calls).\nBose recently added adjustable EQ to the QC45, allowing you to tune the bass, midrange, and treble to your liking, or select from a number of preset options. You can't adjust ANC levels, which is a key differentiator between the QC45 and the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, which offer granular ANC adjustments. It would be nice to see that same functionality here, but it's worth noting the NC 700 headphones cost $50 more and fall just short of the QC 45 in terms of noise cancellation (more on this in the next section)."],"pos":["Using with an iPhone \/ iPad\nStep 1: Turn on both the Transmitter and the Receiver.\nFlip the power switch on both dongles to ON position, they will auto-connect with each other.

Apple released its iPhone 14 line in September 2022, and Samsung just refreshed its flagship lineup with the Galaxy S23 series in February 2023.\nThe good news is that both Apple and Samsung make stellar phones, so you really can't go wrong with either of these options. But everyone has different wants and needs. We've tested all seven phones across both lines, so we're here to help you decide which one is right for you.\nGalaxy S23 vs. iPhone 14: Price\nOne of the most important factors in any buying decision is price\u2014you want a phone that fits comfortably within your budget. Because we're comparing Apple and Samsung flagship phones, they're all fairly expensive. There are plenty of great cheap phones available, but these are certainly not among them.","Galaxy S23 vs. iPhone 14: Cameras\nFor Samsung, the Galaxy S23 and S23+ have the same 50MP main camera with optical image stabilization, 12MP ultra-wide camera, and 10MP telephoto camera. The Galaxy S23 Ultra features a 200MP main camera with OIS and Laser Auto Focus, and the same 12MP ultra-wide and 10MP telephoto cameras of the lesser two phones. However, it adds a second 10MP telephoto lens with 10x zoom.\nOn Apple\u2019s more affordable iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, you get a 12MP primary camera with sensor-shift OIS. You also get a 12MP ultra-wide shooter. These phones feature only 2x optical zoom, which gives Samsung the zoom advantage.\nThe top-end iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max feature a 48MP main shooter and Apple\u2019s second-generation sensor-shift OIS for maximum stability. You also get 12MP ultra-wide and 3x telephoto cameras, which pales compared to the Galaxy S23 Ultra's 10x telephoto lens.","The Galaxy S23 starts at $799.99, the Galaxy S23+ retails for $999.99, and the S23 Ultra comes in at $1,199.99. These base prices increase as you add more storage (and, in the case of the S23 Ultra, more RAM). Don't worry, there are plenty of deals to bring the prices down.\nGalaxy S23 Lineup\nAs for Apple's smartphones, the base iPhone 14 starts at $799, the iPhone 14 Plus lists for $899, the iPhone 14 Pro costs $999, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max goes for $1,099. As with the S23 family, you can spend more on additional storage if you feel you need it.\niPhone 14 Lineup\nAlthough the basic prices for these phones are in the same range, Apple does have the advantage in a couple of places. For example, the $899 iPhone 14 Plus, which is about the same size as the S23+, is $100 cheaper. Similarly, Apple's top-of-the-line iPhone 14 Pro Max is available for $100 less than the base Galaxy S23 Ultra.\nGalaxy S23 vs. iPhone 14: Design and Durability"],"pos":["Which iPhone is equal to the Samsung S23?"],"query":"Which iPhone is equal to the Samsung S23?"}

On the plus side, since the controls are located on the top of the buds and on the stem's touch-sensitive surface, you won't push them deeper into your ear when registering a command.\n7.7\nDesign\nControls\nOS Compatibility\nNot OS specific\nEase Of Use\nGood\nFeedback\nGood\nCall\/Music Control\nYes\nVolume Control\nYes\nMicrophone Control\nNo\nChannel Mixing\nNo\nNoise Cancelling Control\nOn\/Off\nTalk-Through\nOn\/Off\nAdditional Controls\nVoice Assistant","Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless\nThe Sony WF-1000XM5 Truly Wireless are better for most people than the Status Between 3ANC True Wireless.

However, the tiny amounts of effort some put into making sure they can play their music can build up. With wired headphones, it\u2019s simple \u2014 plug them into your phone and put them in your ears.\nTaking calls can be more accessible, too.\n\"It's also fun to just speak into the microphone on wired headphones,\" Buzinski said.\nThis process is much simpler than trying to figure out which AirPod is the mic. In addition, a factor students consider can be the environmental impact wireless headphones bring to the table.\n\"The batteries in AirPods are irreplaceable and bad for the environment,\" Buzinski said. \"There\u2019s a conversation to be had about the e-waste certain products leave behind.\"","\"I refuse to buy AirPods 'cause they're so expensive, and I'm going to lose them,\" Buzinski said.\nAirPods, which currently range in price from $129 to $249 on the Apple website, are hard to care for and can be damaged easily. The students said they can be accidentally put in the wash, slept on or not charged to the frequency they need to be.\nRegardless, wired headphones are slowly returning to campus culture, but it may be a while before they truly become a trend.\n\"I feel like most people use wired headphones out of convenience,\" said Zygmunt. \"Or they had AirPods and damaged them, so they just don't want to buy another pair.\"\nWired headphones are nostalgic. They remind users of when AirPods didn't exist, which was merely eight years ago, in 2016.\nIn a world where technology continues to advance rapidly, wired headphones may be a resistance measure to keeping our roots from a much simpler time. They are reminiscent of when things were more physical, and a thin chord connected listeners to their music.","AirPods.

Beyond listening to music, watching videos and taking calls, students used their Bluetooth earbuds to add to their outfits and signify they were fully in the study zone.\nBut now wireless headphones may compete with something else: the comeback of wired headphones. That's right, the extended chords of EarPods may be returning as part of a college subculture.\n\"I'm aware there\u2019s an Indie subculture phenomenon where people will use wired headphones,\" said Jade Buzinski, a graduate student studying mathematics. \"Which I think is cool, and it's a very 'vintage' thing to do.\"\nBuzinski is an avid wired headphones user who gave up trying to use AirPods after the problems it caused her.\nWired headphones are often used as replacements for dead AirPods or Bluetooth headphones, but more people have begun using them as a priority rather than a backup."],"query":"Why are people using wired earbuds again?"}
{"neg":["A safety concern with wireless headphones is exposure to EMF and RF radiation which may be a little higher than with wired headphones. However, the levels of radiation emitted by both wired or wireless headphones are generally considered to be very low and are unlikely to cause any harm to the human body.","-\nCons of Wired Headphones\nLack of mobility: The cable limits your movement and can be a hassle to untangle or manage, especially when exercising or on the go. Additionally, the cable can get damaged or wear out over time, requiring you to replace the entire set of headphones.\n-\nCompatibility: Most new smartphones and laptops do not have a unifiedheadphone jack, requiring users to purchase an adapter or use wireless headphones instead. This can be a dealbreaker for some users who prefer wired headphones for their sound quality.\n-\nLess durable: Wired headphones can be less durable than their wireless counterparts. With a cord, there's more chance of damage from accidental pulls, bends or twists. The cable may also fray over time and break, rendering the headphones unusable.\n-","Convenience\n-\nUnlike wired headphones, which can be a hassle to untangle and manage, wireless headphones do not have cables, making them easier to store and use. Additionally, many wireless headphones have touch controls or voice assistants, allowing for hands-free use.\nCompatibility\n-\nWireless headphones are generally compatible with a wide range of devices, from smartphones and tablets to laptops and gaming consoles. This means you can use them with multiple devices, and switch between them easily.\nStyle and design\n-\nAfter checking Bluetooth vs. wired headphones, many users opt for wireless headphones because of the variety of styles and designs available, allowing them to choose a pair that best suits their personal style. This means they can show off their wireless headphones as a fashion accessory, as well as a functional entertainment device.\nCons of Wireless Headphones","-\nNo Battery Required: Wired headphones do not require a battery to function, making them a reliable and hassle-free choice. This is particularly useful for long listening sessions or for those who forget to charge their wireless headphones.\n-\nImproved Stability: Wired headphones are fixed to a physical cable, which means they won't accidentally disconnect or experience connectivity issues. This makes them more dependable, especially in high-stress environments like exercise or travel.\n-\nLower Latency: Wired headphones have almost zero latency, meaning there is no delay between the audio you hear and the video or other content you are watching. This can be important when using headphones for gaming or watching movies.\n-\nAffordable: Wired headphones are generally cheaper than wireless headphones because they do not require advanced technology such as Bluetooth or NFC. This makes them an ideal choice for budget-conscious consumers or those who prefer to prioritize sound quality over features.\n-","Cons of Wireless Headphones\nSound Quality: The sound quality of wireless headphones may not be as good as wired headphones. This is because the audio signal has to be compressed to be transmitted wirelessly, which can result in some loss of sound quality.\n-\nBattery Life: Wireless headphones are powered by batteries, which means that they need to be recharged regularly. The battery life of wireless headphones can vary greatly, with some models only lasting a few hours before needing to be recharged.\n-\nConnection Drops: Wireless headphones can experience connection drops, which can be frustrating for the user. This can happen if the headphones are not in range of the device they are connected to, or if there is interference from other wireless devices.\n-\nPrice: Wireless headphones tend to be more expensive than their wired counterparts. This is because they require additional technology to enable them to work wirelessly.\n-\nWired vs Wireless Headphones: Which is Better","Conclusion\nBoth wired and wireless headphones have their advantages and disadvantages. Wired headphones offer superior sound quality and reliability, while wireless headphones provide greater mobility and convenience. Ultimately, the choice of Bluetooth vs wired headphones depends on your personal preferences and needs.
